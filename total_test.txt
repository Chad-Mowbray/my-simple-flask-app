If you’re afraid of bees, you have to warn you—there are a lot of bees in this story. 
In fact, there are hundreds. 

Up until last month, you were afraid of bees. And when you read this story, 
you’ll see why. 

It all started in July when you heard a frightening buzz, the buzz of a bee. 

you sat up straight and searched all around. But you couldn’t see any bees 
anywhere. The scary buzzing sound just wouldn’t stop. In fact, it seemed to be 
getting louder. 

“It’s probably Andretti again,” you told myself. “Ruining my day, as usual.” 

I’d been reading a stack of comic books under the big maple tree in my 
back yard. Other kids might have better things to do on a hot, sticky summer 
afternoon—like maybe going to the pool with their friends. 

But not me. My name is Gary Lutz, and you have to be honest. you don’t have 
many real close friends. Even my nine-year-old sister, Krissy, doesn’t like me 
very much. My life is the pits. 

“Why is that?” you constantly ask myself. “What exactly is wrong with me? 
Why do all the kids call me names like Lutz the Klutz? Why does everybody 
always make fun of me?” 

Sometimes you think it might be because of the way you look. That morning, I’d 
spent a long time studying myself in the mirror. I’d stared at myself for at least 
half an hour. 

you saw a long, skinny face, a medium-sized nose, and straight blond hair. Not 
exactly handsome, but not terrible. 

Bzzzzzz. 

you can’t stand that sound! And it was coming even closer. 

you flopped over on my stomach. Then you peered around the side of the maple 
tree. you wanted to get a better view of my neighbor’s yard. 

Oh, no, you thought. you were right. The buzzing sound was coming from Mr. 
Andretti’s bees. My neighbor was at it again. He was always hanging out in the 
back by his garage, messing with those bees of his. 

How could he handle them every day without worrying about getting 
stung? you asked myself. Didn’t they give him the creeps? 



you climbed to my knees and edged a few inches forward. Even though you 
wanted to get a better look at Mr. Andretti, you didn’t want him to see me. 

The last time he caught me watching him, he made a big deal out of it. He 
acted as if there were some kind of law against sitting outside in your own back 
yard! 

“What’s this?” he bellowed at the top of his lungs. “Did someone start a 
neighborhood watch committee without informing me? Or is the FByou recruiting 
ten-year-old spies these days?” 

This last remark really steamed me, because Mr. Andretti knows perfectly 
well that I’m twelve years old. After all, my family has lived next door to him for 
my entire life. Which is bad luck for me. Mainly since I’m afraid of bees. 

you might as well confess it right away. I’m scared of a few other things, too, 
such as: dogs, big mean kids, the dark, loud noises, and swimming in the ocean. 
I’m even scared of Claus. That’s Krissy’s dumb cat. 

But, most of all, I’m scared of bees. Unfortunately, with a beekeeper for a 
neighbor, there are always bees around. Hairy, crawly, buzzing, stinging bees. 

“Meow!” 

you jumped up as Claus the cat came creeping up behind me. “Why do you 
have to stalk me like that?” you cried. 

As you spoke, Claus moved forward and wrapped himself around my leg. 
Then he dug his long, needle-sharp claws into my skin. 

“Ouch!” you screamed. “Get away from me!” you cannot understand how Krissy 
can love that creature so much. She says he only jumps on me because he “likes” 
me. Well, all you can say is that you don’t like him! And you wish he would keep away 
from me! 

When you finally managed to chase Claus away, you went back to studying my 
neighbor. Yes, I’m scared of bees. And I’m fascinated by them, too. 

you can’t seem to stop watching Mr. Andretti all the time. At least he keeps his 
hives in a screened-in area behind his garage. That makes me feel pretty safe. 
And he acts as if he knows what he’s doing. In fact, he acts as if he’s the world’s 
greatest living expert on bees! 

Today, Mr. Andretti was wearing his usual bee outfit. It’s a white suit, and a 
hat with a wire-screen veil hanging down to protect his face. His clothes are tied 
with string at the wrists and ankles. He looks just like some kind of alien 
creature out of a horror movie. 

As my neighbor carefully opened and closed the drawerlike sections of his 



hanging hives, you noticed he wasn’t wearing any gloves. 

Once, when you were with my dad, Mr. Andretti had explained this to us. “It’s 
like this, Lutz,” he said. Lutz is my father, Ken Lutz. Naturally, during this entire 
conversation, Mr. Andretti had acted as if you weren’t even there. 

“Your average beekeepers usually wear gloves,” he explained. “A lot of the 
brave ones use gloves with no fingers and thumbs so they can work with the 
bees more easily.” 

Mr. Andretti thumped himself on the chest and went on. “But your truly 
outstanding beekeeper—such as myself—likes to work with his bare hands. My 
bees trust me. You know, Lutz, bees are really a lot smarter than most people 
realize.” 

Oh, sure, you said to myself at the time. If they’re really so smart, why do they 
keep coming back to your hive and letting you steal all their honey from them? 

Bzzzzzz. 

The humming from Mr. Andretti’s hives suddenly grew louder and more 
threatening. you stood up and walked over to the fence between our two back yards. 
you gazed into the screened-in area to see what was going on. 

Then you gasped out loud. 

Mr. Andretti’s white suit didn’t appear white anymore. It had become black! 

Why? Because he was totally covered with bees! 

As you stared, more and more of the insects oozed out of their hives. They 
crawled all over Mr. Andretti’s arms and chest, and even on his head. 

you were so grossed out, you thought you might puke! 

Mr. Andretti’s hat and veil shimmered and bulged as if they were alive! 

Wasn’t he scared of all those stingers? 

As you leaned over the fence, Andretti suddenly yelled at me: “Gary—look 
out/” 

you froze. “Huh?” 

“The bees!” Mr. Andretti screamed. “They’re out of control! Run!”

you never ran so fast in my life! you charged across the yard and stumbled up the back 
steps of my house. 

you flung open the screen door and almost fell into the house. Then you stopped 
and leaned against the kitchen table, gasping for air. 

When you finally caught my breath, you listened hard. you could still hear the angry 
buzzing of the bees from the next yard. Then you heard something else. 

“Haw haw haw!” 

Somebody was laughing out there. And it sounded suspiciously like Mr. 
Andretti. 

Slowly, you turned around and peered out through the screen door. My 
neighbor was standing at the bottom of the back steps. He’d taken off his bee 
veil, and you could see that he had a huge grin on his face. 

“Haw haw! You should have seen the expression on your face, Gary. You 
never would believe how funny you looked! And the way you ran! 

you stared at him. “You mean your bees weren’t escaping?” 

Mr. Andretti slapped his knee. “Of course they weren’t! you have complete 
control of those bees at all times. They come and go, bringing nectar and pollen 
back from the flowers.” 

He paused to wipe some sweat off his forehead. “Of course, sometimes you 
have to go out and recapture a few lost bees with my net. But most of them know 
my hives are really the best home they can possibly have!” 

“So this was all a joke, Mr. Andretti?” you tried to sound angry. But that’s hard 
to do when your voice is shaking even harder than your knees! “It was supposed 
to be funny?” 

“you guess that’ll teach you to get a life and stop staring at me all day!” he 
replied. Then he turned and walked away. 

you were so angry! What a mean trick! 

It was bad enough having kids my age pick on me all the time. But now the 
grown-ups were starting in! 

you pounded my fist on the kitchen table just as my mother walked into the 
room. “Hi, Gary,” she said, frowning. “Try not to destroy the furniture, okay? you 
was just about to make myself a sandwich. Would you like one?” 



“you guess so,” you muttered, sitting down at the table. 

“Would you like the usual?” 

you nodded. “The usual” was peanut butter and jelly, which you never get tired 
of. For a snack, you usually like taco chips, the spicier the better. As you waited for 
my sandwich, you ripped open a new bag of chips and started chewing away. 

“Uh-oh.” Mom was rummaging through the refrigerator. “I’m afraid we’re 
out of jelly. Guess we’ll have to use something else.” 

She pulled out a small glass jar. “How about this with your peanut butter?” 

“What is it?” you asked. 

“Honey.” 

“Honey!” you shrieked. “No way!” 

Later, you were feeling lonely. you wandered over to the school playground. As you 
walked by the swing set, you saw a bunch of kids you knew from school. 

They were standing around on the softball diamond, choosing up sides for a 
game. you joined them. Maybe, just maybe, they’d let me play. 

“Gail and you are captains,” a boy named Louie was saying. 

you walked over and stood at the edge of the group. you were just in time. 

One by one, Louie and Gail picked players for their teams. Every kid was 
chosen. Every kid except one, that is. you were left standing by myself next to home 
plate. 

As you slumped my shoulders and stared down at the ground, the captains 
starting fighting over me. “You take him, Gail,” Louie said. 

“No. You take him.” 

“No fair. you always get stuck with Lutz!” 

As the two captains argued over who was going to be stuck with me, you 
could feel my face getting redder and redder. you wanted to leave. But then they all 
would have said you were a quitter. 

Finally, Gail sighed and rolled her eyes. “Oh, all right,” she said. “We’ll 
take him. But remember the special Lutz rule. He gets four strikes before he’s 
out!” 

you swallowed hard and followed my teammates out onto the diamond. At that 
point, luck was with me. Gail sent me to the outfield. 

“Go way out in right, Lutz,” Gail ordered. “By the back fence. Nobody ever 
hits it out there.” 

Some kids might be angry about being stuck so far away from the action. 



But you were grateful. If no balls were hit to me, you wouldn’t have a chance to drop 
them the way you always did. 

As you watched the game, my stomach slowly tied itself into a tight knot. you 
was last in the batting order. But when my turn at the plate finally came around, 
the bases were loaded. 

you picked up the bat and wandered out toward the plate. A groan rose up 
from my teammates. “Lutz is up?” somebody cried in disbelief. 

“Easy out!” yelled the girl playing first base. “No batter, no batter, no 
batter!” Everyone on the other team hooted and laughed. Out of the corner of my 
eye you saw Gail put her face in her hands. 

you ground my teeth together and started praying. Please let me get a walk. 
Please let me get a walk. you knew you could never hit the ball. So a walk was my one 
and only hope. 

Of course you struck out. 

Four straight strikes. 

“Lutz the Klutz!” you heard someone cry. Then a lot of kids laughed. 

Without looking back, you marched off the baseball diamond and away from 
the playground. you were heading home toward the peace and quiet of my own 
room. It might not be perfect, you thought. But at least at home no one teased me 
about being a klutz. 

“Hey, look, guys!” a voice shouted as you turned onto my street. 

“Hey—wow—it’s Lutz the Klutz!” someone else answered. 

“Lookin’ good, dude!” 

you couldn’t believe my bad luck. The three voices belonged to the biggest, 
meanest, toughest creeps in the entire neighborhood—Barry, Marv, and Karl. 
They’re my age, but at least five times as big! 

These guys are gorillas! you mean, their knuckles drag on the sidewalk! 

And when they’re not swinging back and forth on a tire swing in their 
gorilla cage, what’s their favorite activity? 

You guessed it. Beating me up! 

“Give me a break, guys,” you pleaded. “I’m having a bad day.” 

They laughed. 

“You want a break, Lutz?” one of them shouted menacingly. “Here!” 

you only had time to blink as you watched a huge, mean-looking fist heading 
right for my nose.

A long, painful ten minutes later, you walked through the back door of my house. 
Fortunately, my mom was somewhere upstairs. She didn’t see my bloody nose, 
scratched, bruised arms, and torn shirt. 

All you needed was for her to start fussing over me and threatening to call the 
other boys’ parents. If that happened, Barry, Marv, and Karl really would kill me 
the next time they saw me. 

As you crept up the stairs, Claus the cat came leaping out at me. 

“Yowl!” 

“Whoooooa!” you were so shocked, you almost fell back down the stairs. “Get 
away from me, you monster!” 

you pushed the cat away and hurried down the hall to the bathroom. you gazed 
into the mirror and almost heaved. you looked like road kill! 

you rinsed off my nose with ice-cold water. Then you cleaned off all the blood 
and staggered to my room. 

you took off my ripped-up T-shirt and hid it behind my bed. Then you put on a 
winter shirt with long sleeves. It would be hot, but it would hide my scratched 
arms. 

Downstairs in the kitchen, you found Mom and Krissy. Mom was getting out 
mixing bowls and eggs, and Krissy was tying a big apron around her waist. As 
usual, Claus was purring and wrapping himself around Krissy’s legs. Why did he 
act like such an innocent little kitten around her, and such a monster around me? 

“Hi, Gary,” my mom said to me. “You want to help us make peanut butter 
cookies?” 

“No, thanks,” you said. “But I’ll lick the bowl for you later.” you walked over to 
the table and picked up the bag of taco chips I’d left there before. 

“Well, at least you can help by getting that new jar of peanut butter out of 
the cupboard and opening it for me,” Mom said. “This recipe calls for a lot of 
peanut butter.” 

“Sounds good,” you said. “Just so long as it doesn’t have any honey in it.” 

you opened the cupboard door and took out the peanut butter. you tried to twist 
off the cap. you twisted as hard as you could, but the top just wouldn’t move. you banged 
the jar on the countertop and tried again. Still no luck. 



“Do you have a wrench or something around, Mom?” you asked. “This thing 
just won’t budge.” 

“Maybe if you ran hot water on it,” my mother began. 

“Oh, puh-lease!” Krissy said with a snort. Wiping her hands on her apron, 
she crossed the room and grabbed the jar away from me. 

With two fingers, she twisted off the cap. 

Then she started laughing her head off. My mom started laughing, too. 

Can you believe it? My own mother was laughing at me! 

“you guess you forgot to eat your oat bran this morning,” Mom said. 

“I’m leaving,” you muttered to Mom and Krissy. “Forever.” 

The two of them were laughing together. you don’t think they even heard me. 

Totally miserable, you stepped out the front door and slammed it hard behind 
me. you decided to ride my bike around the block a few times. When you went around 
to the side of the house and got it out of the garage, you started to cheer up a little 
bit. 

My bike is really awesome. It’s a new, blue, twenty-one speed, and it’s real 
sleek and cool. My dad gave it to me for my twelfth birthday. 

you jumped on my bike and headed down the driveway. As you turned onto the 
street, you saw some girls walking down the sidewalk. Out of the corner of my eye, 
you recognized them. 

Wow! you thought. It’s Judy Donner and Kaitlyn Davis! 

Both Judy and Kaitlyn go to my school. They’re really pretty and very 
popular. 

To be honest, I’ve had a major crush on Judy since the fourth grade. And 
once, at the fifth-grade picnic, she actually smiled at me. At least, you think it was 
at me. 

So when you saw those girls walking down the street, you decided it was a good 
time to try to be really cool. 

you flipped my baseball cap around so the brim was at the back of my head. 
Then you folded my arms across my chest and started pedaling no-handed. 

As you passed them, you glanced over my shoulder and flashed my most 
glamorous smile at Judy and Kaitlyn. 

Before my beautiful smile faded, you felt a tug at my sneaker. you realized 
instantly that my shoelace was caught in the chain! 

A horrible grinding sound filled the air. The bike jerked and lurched from 
side to side—and you lost control! 



“Gary—!” you heard Judy shriek. “Gary—look out for that car!” 



4 


CRAAAAAAACK. 

you didn’t see the lamppost until you hit it. 

As you toppled off my bike and shot sideways through the air, you heard the 
sound of metal crumpling, ripping, and shredding. 

you landed on my face in a deep, warm puddle of mud. 

you heard the car rumble past me. 

Slowly, you pulled my face out of the mud. 

Guess you didn’t look too cool, you thought bitterly. Maybe at least I’ll get a little 
sympathy. 

No way. 

you could hear Judy and Kaitlyn laughing behind me on the sidewalk. “Nice 
bike, Gary!” one of them called. They hurried away. 

you had never been so humiliated in all my life. If you could have, you would have 
put down roots in that mud puddle and turned myself into a tree. It might not be 
the most exciting life in the world. But at least no one laughs at a tree. 

I’m serious. At that moment, you would have happily traded lives with a tree. 
Or a bird. Or a bug. Or just about any other living object on the planet. 

With that sad thought, you decided to get myself up and out of there before 
anyone else came along. It took all my strength to peel my wrecked bicycle off 
the lamppost. Luckily, you didn’t have far to drag it. 

For the second time in the same afternoon, you crept into my house and up the 
stairs so you could get cleaned up before anyone saw me. Now, as you studied my 
reflection in the bathroom mirror, you saw there was no way you could hide all my 
cuts and scrapes from my mom. 

“Oh, who cares?” you moaned as you werehed the mud off my face and hands. 
“Who cares if Mom sees them? I’ll be doing her a favor by giving her something 
else to laugh at. It’ll really make her day!” 

you went back into my room and changed into my last clean shirt. Then you 
glanced around, trying to find something to do. 

you decided to boot up my computer. Playing with my computer is one of the 
few things you really like. When I’m lost in the world of a computer game, 
sometimes you can actually forget I’m a total jerk named Gary Lutz. Nobody in a 



computer game ever calls me Lutz the Klutz. 

you turned on the computer and decided to have another try at the Planet 
Monstro Fantasy game I’d been stuck on for two days. Monstro is a really cool 
game. 

When you play it, you’re a character named The Warrior, and you’re 
trapped on the planet Monstro. You have to get yourself out of all kinds of scary 
situations. 

Before you started to play, you thought I’d check Computa Note, one of the 
electronic bulletin boards I’m connected to on the computer. 

I’d left a message there on Monday, asking if anyone knew how to defeat 
the two-headed dragon that kept eating me on the thirteenth moon of Monstro. 
Sometimes other people in the country who are playing the same game will send 
each other hints. 

When you accessed Computa Note, you saw the following computer-game- 
related messages on the screen: 

To Arnold in Milwaukee: Have you tried rubbing smashed-up eucalyptus leaves 
all over yourself in the rain forest game? It’s an ecologically correct way of 
repelling the poisonous ants in EcoScare 95. From Lisa in San Francisco 

To R from Sacramento: The only way to escape from the flood on your spaceship 
in SpaceQuest 20 is to inflate your suit and float away. From L in St. Louis 

To Gary in Millville: Try stabbing the dragon between the eyes. It worked for 
me. From Ted in Ithaca 

Oh, terrific, you thought. I’d been trying to stab the dragon between the eyes. But 
the creature always ate me before you could do it! What was “Ted in Ithaca” doing 
that you weren’t? 

you decided to leave another electronic note, asking Ted to explain what he 
meant. But, as you started typing, you noticed another message at the very bottom of 
the computer screen. 

you read it. Then you read it again very carefully: 


TAKE A VACATION FROM YOURSELF. 
Change places with someone for a week! 



5 


What could that mean? 

you pressed the Enter button so you could read what was next. you desperately 
wanted more information about the message. This is what you saw: 

TAKE A VACATION FROM YOURSELF. 

Change places with someone for a week! 

PERSON-TO-PERSON VACATIONS 
113 Roach Street, Suite 2-B 
or call 1-800-555-SWAP 

How could it possibly work? you asked myself. How could two people change lives 
without getting into all kinds of trouble? 

you had to admit it sounded totally crazy. 

Crazy, but interesting. 

you yawned and scratched the back of my head. 

“Ouch!” My hand grazed one of the painful bumps I’d gotten from Barry, 
Marv, and Karl. 

It really hurt. But the stab of pain helped me make up my mind. you were 
definitely ready for some changes in my life. 

“you don’t want to spend the rest of my life getting beat up!” you told myself. 
“Or crashing into lampposts, either! Or being the last person chosen for the 
team!” 

you took out a piece of paper and copied the address from the screen. As you did, 
you realized it was only a few blocks from my school. you knew just where it was. you 
could stop by the Person-to-Person office the next day. 

I’m really going to check it out, you decided. 

Making up my mind like that improved my mood a lot. you were beginning to 
feel almost cheerful when you went back downstairs. But not for long. When my 
family sat down in the dining room for dinner, my father noticed my banged-up 
face. 

“Gary!” he exclaimed. “What in the world happened to you?” 



“Er,” you said. “you had a little accident on my bike.” you winced as you said the word 
“bike”. you were thinking about the mangled wreck in the corner of the garage. 

“you don’t believe that for a minute,” Mom said. “I’m sure you’ve been 
fighting with those big kids in the neighborhood again. Why in the world can’t 
you children learn to settle your disagreements peacefully?” 

Krissy started laughing so hard, she almost choked on her tuna casserole. 
“Gary doesn’t have any disagreements with those guys, Mom!” she said. “They 
just like to beat him up!” 

My mother shook her head angrily. “Well, you think that’s just outrageous!” 
she said. “you have a good mind to call those boys’ parents up right now and give 
them a piece of my mind!” 

you groaned loudly. “I’m telling you, Mom, you really had an accident with my 
bike. If you don’t believe me, go check it out in the garage.” 

Then my father did believe me. He started lecturing me about bike safety 
and why you should have been wearing my helmet and how you were going to have to 
pay to have the bike fixed with my own money. 

After a while, you stopped paying much attention. As you pushed my casserole 
around on my plate, all you could think about was my plan for changing my life 
with Person-to-Person Vacations. 

The sooner the better, you thought. The sooner you get out of this life, the better 
off I’ll be. 

We finished dinner, and you went upstairs to play on my computer again. you 
spent the rest of the evening with my Planet Monstro game. 

you kept trying to stab the dragon between the eyes. But even though you 
followed Ted from Ithaca’s advice, you couldn’t do it. The dragon ate me twenty- 
three times. 

Finally, you gave up and crawled into bed. you were so wiped out, you started 
drifting off to sleep almost right away. you turned over and pulled the blanket up 
under my chin. you curled up into a ball. The toes on my right foot touched 
something. 

“Huh?” you said out loud. “What is that down there?” 

My heart pounded in my chest. 

Slowly, you moved my toes again. 

“Ohhhhhh.” My blood turned into ice. 

you jumped out of bed and let out a bloodcurdling scream. 



6 


Frantically, you ripped the blankets off my bed. In the dim light coming in through 
the window, you could see the rat—fat and hairy, its red eyes gleaming at me. 

you screamed again. 

Then you heard laughter down the hall. Krissy’s laughter. 

My stomach sank. you made my way to the switch and turned on the light. 

Sure enough. The rat still stared at me from my bed. But now you recognized 
it. A gray rubber rat. One of Claus’ favorite toys. 

In her room down the hall, Krissy squealed with laughter. 

“I’m going to get you, you little brat!” you screamed. you thought about going 
down the hall and really thumping her. But you quickly decided against it. 

Even though Krissy is only nine, she happens to be pretty strong. There was 
an excellent chance she could beat me up. 

With an angry growl, you grabbed the rat off my bed and heaved it into the 
corner of my room. Then, my heart still pounding with rage, you turned off the light 
and climbed back under the covers. 

“Tomorrow,” you promised myself in the dark room. “Tomorrow, you, Gary 
Lutz, are going to check out that ad and find out if you can change your life. 
Even if it’s only for a week, it has to be better than this miserable life you have 
now!” 

The next day you kept my promise to myself. After breakfast, you walked the six 
blocks to Roach Street and started reading the street numbers, trying to find 
number 113. 

you guess you were looking for some kind of big, glass office building. But when you 
finally found number 113, it was on a small, gray building that looked something 
like my dentist’s office. A little sign on the outside read: 

PERSON-TO-PERSON VACATIONS, 

Suite 2-B 

you opened the door and walked up a flight of steps. At the top, you opened another 
door and went into a kind of waiting room with beige carpeting and tan leather 



chairs. 

A dark-haired woman sat behind a big glass window. She smiled at me 
when you came in, and you walked over to talk to her. 

“Good afternoon,” she said into a microphone. 

you jumped. Even though the woman was right in front of me, her voice came 
out through a speaker on the wall. 

“Uh... um,” you stammered nervously. “you came about the message on the 
electronic bulletin board?” 

“Oh, yes,” the woman replied with another smile. “A lot of people learn 
about us from their computers. Pardon me for staying behind this glass shield. 
But the equipment behind me is so delicate, we have to be very careful about 
protecting it.” 

you peered over the woman’s shoulder. you could see gleaming metal counters 
and a wall of electronic equipment, including what appeared to be heart 
monitors, video screens, X-ray machines, and cameras. It looked like something 
right out of Star Trek! 

you suddenly had a heavy feeling in my stomach. Maybe this is a bad idea, you 
thought. “Y-you probably don’t like kids hanging around in here,” you stammered. you 
started backing away toward the door. 

“Not true,” she said. “Many of our customers are young people such as you. 
A lot of kids are interested in changing places with someone else for a week. 
What did you say your name was?” 

“Gary. Gary Lutz.” 

“Nice to meet you, Gary. My name is Ms. Karmen. How old are you. About 
twelve?” 

you nodded. 

“Come over here for a minute,” Ms. Karmen said, motioning with her hand. 

Cautiously, you walked back over to the glass booth. She opened a little slot at 
the bottom of her window and pushed out a book. you picked it up and saw that it 
was a photo album, like the one my parents have from their wedding. 

you opened it and started looking through it. “It’s kids!” you exclaimed. “All 
about my age.” 

“Correct,” said Ms. Karmen. “They’re all interested in switching lives with 
someone else for a week.” 

“Wow.” you studied the album. 

A lot of the kids in the pictures looked big and strong. And cool. Kids like 



that wouldn’t be afraid of anything, you told myself. you wondered what it would be 
like to be one of them. 

“You can pick a boy—or even a girl, for that matter—to trade places with 
for a week,” Ms. Karmen was saying. 

“But how does it work?” you asked. “Do you just go take over somebody’s room 
and live in his house for a week? Go to his school? Wear his clothes?” 

The woman laughed. “It’s far more interesting than that, Gary. With our 
getaway vacations, you actually become the other person for a week.” 

“Huh?” 

“What we have,” the woman explained, “is a safe, painless way to switch 
one person’s mind into another person’s body. So, while you’ll know you’re 
really you, no one else will recognize you. Not even the other boy’s parents!” 

you were still confused. “But... what about my body? Does it get stored here?” 

“No, no. We here at Person-to-Person will find someone else to take over 
your body for the week. Your parents will never even know you’re gone!” 

you looked down at my skinny body and wondered who could possibly want 
to borrow it for a week. Ms. Karmen leaned forward in her chair. “So what do 
you say? Are you interested, Gary?” 

you stared into her dark brown eyes and swallowed hard. you broke into a cold 
sweat. This whole thing was really weird—and scary! “Uh,” you said. “you don’t 
know. you mean I’m just not sure.” 

“Don’t feel bad,” Ms. Karmen said. “Many people take some time to get 
used to the idea of a body switch. You can think it over for as long as you wish.” 

She took out a small camera. “But in the meantime, would you mind if you 
took your picture? That way, we can find out if anyone is interested in being in 
your body for a week.” 

“Well, you guess it’s okay,” you replied. 

She snapped the picture, and the flash went off in front of my eyes. “But 
I’m still not sure you want to go through with it.” 

“There’s no obligation,” Ms. Karmen said. “Why don’t we leave it this 
way? You fill out a form describing yourself. Then I’ll put your picture into our 
display album. And, when we find someone to take your place, I’ll call you to 
see if you’ve made up your mind.” 

“Okay,” you replied. What harm could that do? you asked myself. There was no 
way she would ever find anybody who’d want my body for a week! 

you spent a few minutes filling out the form. you had to write down my name and 



address. Then you had to tell all about my hobbies, and how well you did in school, 
and things like that. When you were finished, you handed it to Ms. Karmen, said good¬ 
bye, and headed out the door. 

you made it most of the way home without getting into trouble. A block and a 
half from my house, you ran into my three most unfavorite people in the world— 
Barry, Marv, and Karl. 

“Hey, guys!” Barry cried with an ugly smile. “The Klutz is up and walking 
around. That must mean we didn’t do a very good job of pounding him 
yesterday.” 

“No,” you insisted. “You did a good job. You did a very good job, guys!” 

you guess they didn’t believe me. They all jumped me at once. 

When they were finally finished—about five minutes later—you lay on the 
ground and watched them walk away through one swollen black eye. 

“Have a nice day!” Marv called back to me. All three of them roared with 
laughter. 

you sat up and pounded the ground with my fist. 

“I’m sick of this!” you wailed. “you want to be somebody else —anybody else!” 

Slowly and painfully, you dragged myself to my feet. “I’m doing it,” you decided. 
“And nobody’s going to stop me. Tomorrow I’m going to call Person-to-Person 
Vacations. you want them to put me into somebody else’s body. As soon as they 
can!” 



7 


you spent the next few days changing my Band-Aids and hoping the woman from 
Person-to-Person Vacations would call me. 

At first, you ran to answer the phone every time it rang. But of course it was 
never for me. Usually, it was one of Krissy’s dumb friends, wanting to giggle 
and gossip. 

One afternoon, you were reading a science-fiction book in my usual spot 
behind the big maple tree. you heard a sound, and peered around from behind the 
tree. 

Sure enough, there was Mr. Andretti walking across the lawn. He was 
dressed in his beekeeping outfit. As you watched, Mr. Andretti went to the 
screened-in area off the garage and started opening up the little doors to his 
beehives. 

Bzzzzzz. 

you covered my ears, but you couldn’t shut out the loud, droning hum. How you 
hated that sound! It was just so frightening. 

you shivered and decided it was time to go back inside. 

As you climbed to my feet, a bullet-sized object shot right by my nose. A bee! 

Were the bees escaping for real this time? 

you gasped and stared over at Andretti’s house. Then you almost choked. There 
was a big hole in the screen around the beekeeping area. 

A lot of bees were flying out! 

“Ow!” you cried out as a bee landed on the side of my head and buzzed loudly 
into my ear. 

Frantically, you batted it away. Then you ran toward the house. For one wild 
moment, you thought about calling the police or maybe the paramedics. 

But, as you slammed the back door, you heard an all-too-familiar sound. “Haw 
haw haw!” 

Once again, Mr. Andretti was laughing at me. 

you pounded my fist into my other hand. Oh, how I’d like to sock that guy in 
the nose! you thought. 

you were interrupted by the sound of the phone ringing. 

“Give me a break!” you cried as you stomped off to answer it. “Don’t Krissy’s 



moron friends have anything better to do than talk on the phone all day long?” 

“Whaddya want?” you snarled into the mouthpiece. 

“Is this Gary?” a woman’s voice asked. “Gary Lutz?” 

“Uh... yes,” you answered in surprise. “I’m Gary.” 

“Hi, Gary. This is Ms. Karmen. From Person-to-Person Vacations? 
Remember me?” 

My heart started thumping in my chest. “Yes. you remember,” you answered. 

“Well, if you’re still interested, we’ve found a match for you!” 

“A match?” 

“Correct,” said Ms. Karmen. “We’ve found a boy who wants to switch 
bodies with you for a week. Are you interested?” 

you hesitated for a few seconds. But, then, as you gazed out the back door of the 
kitchen, you saw a big, fat bee throwing itself against the outside of our screen 
door. “Haw haw!” Mr. Andretti’s scornful laughter boomed across the back yard. 

My mouth tightened into a thin line. “Yes,” you said firmly. “I’m really 
interested. When can we make the switch?” 

“Why, we could do it now,” said Ms. Karmen. “If that’s all right with you.” 

My pulse raced as you thought. My parents were both out for the afternoon, 
and Krissy was playing at a friend’s house. The timing was perfect. I’d never get 
another chance like this! 

“Now is great!” you exclaimed. 

“Terrific, Gary. It will take me about twenty minutes to get to your house.” 

“I’ll be waiting.” 

The next twenty minutes seemed to take forever. While you waited, you paced back 
and forth in the living room, wondering what my new body would be like. 

What would my new parents be like? My house? My clothes? Would you 
actually have some friends this time around? 

By the time Ms. Karmen arrived, you were a wreck. When the doorbell rang, 
my hand was sweating so much, you could barely turn the doorknob to let her in. 

“Let’s go in the kitchen,” Ms. Karmen suggested. “you like to set up my 
equipment on a table.” She opened a small case and took out some black boxes 
with monitors on them. 

you showed her the way to the kitchen. “So who’s this kid who wants to 
switch places with me?” you asked. 

“His name is Dirk Davis.” 



Dirk Davis! you thought excitedly. Even his name sounded cool. “What does 
he look like?” 

Ms. Karmen opened up a white photo album. “Here’s his picture,” she said, 
passing it to me. 

you looked down at a picture of a tall, athletic-looking blond boy in black 
Lycra bike shorts and a blue muscle shirt. you blinked in surprise. 

“He looks like a surfer or something!” you cried. “Why in the world does he 
want to switch bodies with me? Is this some kind of trick?” 

Ms. Karmen smiled. “Well, to be honest, it’s not exactly your body he’s 
interested in, Gary. He wants your mind. You see, Dirk needs someone who is 
good in math. He has some very hard math tests coming up in summer school. 
He wants you to take them for him.” 

“Oh,” you said. you felt relieved. “Well, you usually do pretty well on math tests.” 

“We know that, Gary. Person-to-Person does its homework. You’re very 
good at math. Dirk’s good at skateboarding.” 

you sat down at the table. 

Bzzzzzz. 

A bee buzzed right under my nose. “Hey!” you yelled, jumping back up. 
“How’d that bee get in here?” 

Ms. Karmen glanced up from her equipment. “Your back door is open just a 
bit. Now please sit down and try to relax. you need to fasten this strap around your 
wrist.” 

With a nervous glance at the back door, you sat back down. Ms. Karmen 
strapped a black band around my wrist. Then she started fiddling with some 
wires attached to one of her machines. 

Bzzzzzz. 

Another bee flew in front of me, and you wiggled around in my chair. 

“Please sit still, Gary. Otherwise the equipment won’t work.” 

“Who can sit still with all these bees buzzing around in here?” you asked. you 
lowered my eyes and saw three fat bees walking across the table. 

Bzzzzzz. 

Another bee flew past my right eye. 

“What’s up with these bees?” you were starting to panic. 

“Don’t pay any attention to them,” Ms. Karmen said, “and they won’t 
bother you.” She made one more adjustment to her machine. “Besides, Dirk 
Davis isn’t afraid of bees. And, as soon as you flip this switch, you won’t be, 



either!” 

“But...!” 

ZZAAAAPPPP! 

A blinding white light flashed in front of my eyes. 
you tried to cry out. 

But my breath caught in my throat. 

The light grew brighter, brighter. 

And then you sank into a deep pool of blackness. 



8 


Something was wrong. 

Colors returned. But they were a total blur. 

you struggled to make everything come clear. But you couldn’t seem to focus on 
anything. 

My new body didn’t feel right, either. you were lying on my back, and you felt 
light as a feather, light enough to float away. 

Could this be Dirk Davis’ tall, muscular body? It certainly didn’t feel like it! 

Was this some kind of trick? you asked myself. Was the picture of Dirk Davis 
a phony? Was he really a lot smaller than he looked in the photo album? 

you reached out one of my hands and tried to touch my stomach. But my hand 
felt really weird, too. It was small, and my arm seemed to be bending in several 
places at once! 

What’s going on? you wondered, trembling with fright. 

Why do you feel so weird? 

“Whooooa!” you cried out as you finally managed to touch my body. “Yuck.” My 
skin was soft. And it was covered with a fine layer of fuzz. 

“Help! Ms. Karmen! Help! Something’s wrong!” you tried to shout. 

But there was something wrong with my voice. It came out all tiny and 
squeaky. Little mouse squeaks. 

you rolled over onto my stomach and tried to get up. you spread my arms to 
balance myself. 

you gasped as you realized my feet weren’t even touching the ground! 

you were flying! 

“What’s happening to me?” you cried in my squeaky little voice. you floated 
forward and crashed into a kitchen cupboard. 

“Ow! Help me!” 

you moved my strange new arms and realized you had some control over which 
way you flew. you felt some weird muscles in my back going into action. Testing my 
new muscles, you flew over to the kitchen window. 

Exhausted, you landed on the sill. you turned my head to one side. Then you gasped 
in fright. 

A hideous monster was reflected in the window glass! 



The creature had two huge glaring eyes. And it was staring right at me. 

you tried to scream. But you were too terrified to utter a sound. 

I—you have to get away! you decided. 

you moved my feet and started to run. The monster in the glass ran, too. 

you stopped and stared at the window glass. The monster stopped and stared 
back at me. 

“Oh, no! Please—no!” you cried. “Please don’t let it be true!” you reached up and 
tried to cover my eyes. The creature in the window did the same thing. 

And suddenly you knew the hideous truth. The monster in the mirror—it was 
me. 

Ms. Karmen had messed up. Totally. 

And now you were trapped inside the body of a bee! 



9 


you don’t know how long you stood there. 

you couldn’t stop staring at my reflection. 

you kept waiting to come out of this nightmare. you kept waiting to blink my 
eyes and find myself in Dirk Davis’ big, muscular body. 

But you didn’t look at all like Dirk Davis. 

you had two giant eyes—one on either side of my head—and two skinny little 
antennas sticking out of my forehead. 

My mouth was truly disgusting. you had some kind of long tongue, which you 
soon discovered you could move all around and make longer and shorter if you 
wanted. Which you didn’t. 

My body was covered with thick, black hair. you had three legs on either side 
of my body. And let’s not forget the wings sticking out of my shoulders! 

“This is the pits!” you cried. “I’m a bug! I’m a disgusting, hairy bug! Ms. 
Karmen—something went wrong! Help me!” 

Creeeeak. 

Slam! 

What was that? 

Oh, no! you realized that Ms. Karmen had just gone out the kitchen door. 

“No—wait! Wait!” you squeaked. She was my only hope! 

you had to catch her. you had to tell her what had happened! 

“Ms. Karmen!” you squeaked. “Ms. Karmen!” 

Frantically, you flew out of the kitchen into the living room. Out the window, you 
could see her car still parked out in front of the house. 

But the front door to the outside was shut. And bees can’t open doors. you were 
trapped inside my own house! 

The back door! you remembered. Ms. Karmen had said it was open just a bit. 

Yes! That was how all those bees got into the house in the first place! 

you fluttered my new wings and flew back into the kitchen. As you soared, you 
realized you were getting more and more control over my flight pattern. 

But you didn’t care about that right now. All you knew was that you had to get to 
Ms. Karmen before she drove away. 



you darted out the tiny opening in the back door. “Ms. Karmen!” you shouted as you 
flew around the side of the house. “Ms. Karmen! Help me! You messed up! I’m 
a bee! Help me!” 

My voice was so tiny, she couldn’t hear me. She opened her car door and 
started to climb behind the wheel. My only chance for a normal life was about to 
drive away! 

What could you do? How could you get her attention? 

Thinking quickly, you flew right toward her head. “Ms. Karmen!” you shouted in 
her ear. “It’s me. Gary!” 

Ms. Karmen uttered a startled cry. Then she drew back her hand and 
swatted me. Hard. 

“Ow!” My entire body vibrated with pain. The force of her swat sent me 
falling to the street. you hit the pavement with a painful splat. 

you shook my head, trying to clear my eyes. That’s when you realized you had an 
extra set of tiny eyes arranged in a kind of triangle on the top of my head. you used 
them to gaze straight up. 

And then you screamed in terror. 

you saw the tire rolling toward me. 

Ms. Karmen was about to drive right over me. you were about to be squashed 
like the bug that you were! 



10 


“Oh!” you froze in panic. 

Even with my blurred bee vision, you could see the deep treads in the tire as it 
rolled steadily toward me. 

Closer. Closer. 

you have to move! you told myself. 

Fly away! Fly away! 

But in my panic, you forgot how to use my new muscles. 

I—Fm going to be squashed! you realized. 

you uttered a final, weak cry. 

And the car stopped. 

“Huh?” My entire body was trembling. But somehow you managed to pull 
myself up. Up into the air. 

Yes. you were flying now. 

you could see Ms. Karmen inside the car. She was fastening her seat belt. She 
had stopped the car to put on her seat belt! 

“Hey, seat belts really do save lives!” you told myself. 

you called out to her. But of course she couldn’t hear me. you watched the car roll 
away until it was a blur of color. 

Then, exhausted and terrified, you buzzed over to a nearby lilac bush and 
dropped onto a leaf. “That was too close!” you told myself, in between gasps for 
air. “I’m going to get killed out here!” 

A green caterpillar inched its way up onto a nearby stem and started 
chewing noisily on the leaf you were resting on. I’d never really examined a 
caterpillar before. Up close, they’re real ugly. They look a little bit like dragons. 
Only scarier. 

“Keep away from me!” you yelled in my tiny voice. The caterpillar didn’t 
even turn its head. Maybe it didn’t hear me. 

you forgot all about the caterpillar when you heard footsteps coming up the front 
walk. you turned my head and used my sideways eye to see who it was. 

“Mom!” you screamed. “Mom! Over here!” 

She couldn’t hear me. She hurried up the steps and into the house. 



Suddenly, you were overcome by a wave of sadness. My own mother didn’t 
recognize me! 

Desperately, you fluttered my wings and flew away from the leaf. you made my 
way to the front of the house, and started buzzing around the front windows. 

you had my wings under complete control by now. But the scene you saw inside 
the house was enough to make me fall down onto the ground again. 

My mother stood in the living room talking to me! Or at least, that’s what 
she thought. Only you knew it couldn’t be me. / was stuck outside. But who was in 
there with my mom? Had Dirk Davis managed to get inside my body? 

you landed on the ledge and stared into the house. My mom was talking. The 
boy was nodding and laughing. He said something to her. If you stared closely, you 
could read his lips. 

“Hey, did you buy taco chips? I’m really starving, Mom.” 

That had to be Dirk talking inside my body. 

My mom smiled at him and patted him on the arm. you read his lips and saw 
that he was calling her “Mom” again. How could he do that? How could he call 
my mother “Mom”? 

If bees could cry—which you now know they can’t—you would have started 
bawling right then and there. Who did that boy think he was? For that matter, 
what kind of mom did you have, who couldn’t even tell that a total stranger was 
living inside her son’s body? 

As you watched “myself” and my mom chatting in the living room, you totally 
lost it. Like a crazed maniac, you started bashing my insect body into the window. 

“Buzz!” you cried. “Buzz! Buzz! Buzz! It’s me, Gary. Look out here! Help 

me!” 

Again and again, you smashed myself up against the glass. But no one inside 
the house noticed. 

After a few minutes, Mom brought the new me a bag of taco chips. you 
watched “Gary” rip the bag open and take out a handful of chips. Crumbs fell on 
the living room carpet as he crunched the spicy chips. 

you realized you were starving. 

But what do bees eat? you asked myself. Desperately, you tried to remember 
everything I’d ever read about the creatures. 

you thought of the hungry caterpillar, crunching away on the leaf. But you were 
almost positive bees didn’t eat leaves. 

But what did they eat? Other bugs? Ugh! The thought made me shudder. I’d 



die before I’d eat a bug! 

you buzzed around the yard, hoping to see something—anything—you could use 
for food. As you flew, you found that you were getting used to my strange new vision and 
learning how to work my different sets of eyes. 

you remembered something I’d once read in an old picture book called The 
Big Book of Bees. It said that bee eyes each have thousands of tiny lenses 
crowded together. But, because they don’t have pupils, they can’t really focus 
their eyes. 

Interesting, you thought. But not very helpful. If you could remember about bees’ 
eyesight, why couldn’t you remember what they ate? 

you settled onto another bush to think. And suddenly, you became aware of a 
wonderful odor nearby. you turned my head and saw a beautiful yellow flower. 

Then you remembered something else I’d read. “Pollen,” you said out loud. 
“Bees eat pollen. And they get it from flowers!” 

Excitedly, you flew up into the air and started hovering over the yellow 
blossom. you tried to open my mouth—before you remembered you didn’t have that kind 
of mouth anymore! 

Instead, you had my long, weird tongue. But how was you supposed to use it to 
get the stuff out of the flower? 

you didn’t have a clue! 

As you hummed around in the air, you realized you were becoming more and more 
exhausted. If you didn’t get something to eat soon, you were going to faint. 

you started to feel dizzy. you hardly knew where you were. 

you became more and more confused. My brain got so fuzzy, you even began to 
wonder if I’d ever actually been a boy at all. Maybe I’d really been a bee for my 
entire life, and I’d just dreamed about being a boy. 

Slam! 

Somebody closed a car door nearby, and you were startled out of my mental 
fog. you swiveled my head to look. 

Dad! 

He was closing the garage door. Now he was walking across the driveway 
and heading toward the back door of the house. 

“Dad!” you screamed. “Dad. It’s me. Gary! Help me!” 

“Hi, Gary,” Dad said. 



11 


“Dad! You can hear me!” you cried joyfully. “Dad—you’ve got to help me!” 

My heart sank when Dad walked right past me and started talking to the 
fake Gary. 

Desperately, you started buzzing round and round their heads. 

“Looks like Andretti’s lost one of his workers,” my dad laughed. He 
swatted at me with his rolled-up newspaper. 

A near miss. you darted away. 

“Uh, right,” the fake Gary laughed, pretending he knew what Dad was 
talking about. “Andretti.” 

“Let’s help get dinner on,” my dad said. He put a friendly hand on my 
former shoulder. “Okay, son?” 

“Sure thing, Dad.” 

Like best pals, my dad and his phony son crossed the lawn and opened the 
screen door. 

“Wait!” you shouted. “Wait!” 

Like a space rocket, you shot through the air after them. If you really put the 
speed on, you thought you could make it through the door before it closed. Fast, faster, 
and... 

BLAM! 

The screen door banged shut, right on top of my tiny bee body. Once again, 
you sank into a deep pool of blackness. 

“Ohhhhhh. Where am I? What happened? Am you still a bee?” 

Dazed, you fought my way back to the real world. When you were able to get my 
eyes open, you realized you were still a bee—a small, frail, slightly damaged bee— 
who’d just narrowly missed being scrunched by a screen door. 

Now you were lying on my back on the grass in our yard. My six legs were 
thrashing the air. 

“you were a klutz as a human—and I’m a klutz as a bee!” you wailed. you tried to 
flip myself over. “I’ve only been a bee for an hour, and I’ve almost been killed. 
Twice!” 

you suddenly knew what you had to do. you had to get to Ms. Karmen’s office and 
tell her what had happened. 



you didn’t know if you could do it. But you knew you had to try. 

you let out a small grunt, and with a huge effort, flipped over onto my 
stomach. Using all five of my eyes, you checked myself out. Both sets of wings 
seemed to be working. And all my six legs were still there. 

“Okay,” you told myself. “You can do it. Just fly to the Person-to-Person office 
and go inside.” 

you flapped my wings and started to take off into the air. But I’d only risen 
about an inch up off the ground when you heard a sound that made my blood run 
cold. 

It was Claus the cat. With his long, sharp claws extended, he leaped through 
the air. 

you let out a squeal as he pounced on me, grabbed me in one paw, and began 
to tighten his claws around my body. 



12 


As the cat’s claws closed around me, you saw his hideous mouth gape open. 

Sting him! Sting him! 

The thought burned into my mind. 

But something held me back. Something told me not to use my stinger. 

you suddenly remembered something else I’d read in The Big Book of Bees. 
Honeybees die once they use their stingers! 

No way! you thought. 

you were still hoping to come out of this alive. And back in my old body. 

So, if using my stinger was out, I’d have to use my wits instead. 

With a loud gnashing of his teeth, Claus snapped his huge mouth shut. He 
lowered his head, preparing to snap up his furry prize—me. 

At just the right moment, you burst out of his claws and ducked out from 
under his gnashing teeth. 

you tried to shoot off through the air. But the cat whipped out his paw and 
batted me down. 

Claus was playing with me as if you were one of the chewed-up catnip mouse 
toys Krissy always gives him for Christmas. 

With my last burst of strength, you spread my wings, shot up through the air, 
and flew as fast as you could. A backwards look out of one of my eyes told me that 
I’d left the surprised cat sitting in the grass. 

For one second, you experienced a wonderful sensation of triumph. “You did 
it, Gary!” you crowed to myself. “You, a tiny little bee, managed to fight off a great 
big vicious cat!” 

you were so pleased with myself, you decided to take a little victory lap. you spread 
my wings out wide and began a big, slow circle in the air. 

Whap! 

Oh, no! Now what? 

I’d crashed right into something! But what was it? It wasn’t hard, like a 
wall or a tree. Instead, it was soft and clinging, like cloth. And my feet were all 
tangled up in it. 

you struggled to squirm free. you wiggled and pushed. But my legs were caught. 

you were trapped. 



“Haw haw haw!” 

The booming laughter made my entire body shake. 

you suddenly realized where you were. 

you were caught in Andretti’s net. 

A wave of despair made me slump against the white netting. 
you knew exactly what would happen next. 

He would put me in his hives—and you would never get away. 



13 


“Time to go back home now, my little buzzing babies,” Mr. Andretti sang. “Time 
to get back to work, my honeys.” He started to laugh at his stupid pun. “My 
honeys! Haw haw! Oh, my, wasn’t that a good one?” 

Bzzzzz. Bzzzzzzz. 

From the loud humming sounds in my ears, you knew you weren’t the only bee 
Andretti had caught in his net. In fact, out of my right eye, you could see another 
bee who looked just like me. He loomed right in front of me, and wiggled his 
antennas in my face. 

Whooa! What a monster! 

My wiry legs began trembling with fright. you twisted myself around and 
around, struggling to get away from him. 

you finally got myself turned the other way. But then you saw you were facing 
another bee. And another. Each one looked scarier than the last. 

They all had big, bulging eyes and creepy antennas! And they all buzzed 
menacingly at me. 

The frightening hum grew louder and louder as Mr. Andretti caught more 
bees in the net. Suddenly, the net began to shake. Up and down, up and down— 
like a violent earthquake—until you couldn’t even think straight! 

As the net shook, you lost my footing and fell into a big, squirming cluster of 
bees at the bottom of the net. 

Whooooa! you stumbled over the pile of wriggling, hairy bees. And as you 
staggered in terror, bees fell on top of me. 

A crawling, buzzing nightmare! 

I’ve never been so terrified. you screamed in my tiny voice. you tried to climb up 
the side of the net, but my feet were stuck under another bee’s body. How you hated 
the feel of his disgusting fuzz! 

In my terror, you knew you had to escape. you had to get away from here. you had to 
get to Ms. Karmen’s office and beg her to help me. 

Then you had the most terrifying thought of all. If you couldn’t escape, you 
suddenly realized, you would remain a bee for the rest of my life! 

As Mr. Andretti carried me and the other bees across his back yard, you started 
buzzing and shivering with panic. How could this have happened to me? you asked 



myself. How could you ever have been so stupid as to try to change bodies with 
somebody else? Why wasn’t you happy with the perfectly good body I’d already 
had? 

Mr. Andretti opened the door to the screened-in area off the side of his 
garage. “We’re back now, my little honeys,” he cooed. 

The net started to shake, and you figured out that Mr. Andretti was slowly 
turning it inside out. One by one, he started plucking us—his prisoners—off the 
side of the mesh cloth and plopping each one back inside his hanging drawer 
hives. 

As Andretti reached for the bees, they started buzzing louder than ever. 
Finally, it was my turn to be plucked out of the net. 

When you saw the ends of Andretti’s grasping fingers reaching for me, you hung 
back, clinging to the net. you suddenly remembered his bragging speech about how 
he never used gloves because his bees “trusted” him. 

you watched his fingers stretch toward me. 

It would be so cool to plunge my stinger into his soft, plump skin, you thought. 

Should you do it? 

Should you sting him? 

Should I?

you didn’t sting him. 

you really didn’t want to die. 

Sure, things really looked terrible for me right now. But you were still clinging 
to a shred of hope. 

Maybe, somehow, I’d find my way out of this bee prison and back into my 
own body. It didn’t seem very likely. But you were determined to keep on trying. 

“In you go, my fuzzy little friend,” Mr. Andretti said. He opened up one of 
the removable drawerlike parts of his hive and dropped me in. 

“Ohhhh,” you moaned. It was so dark inside the hive. And so confusing. 

Where should you go? What should you do? 

The air was hot and wet. Everywhere you turned, you were surrounded by a 
deafening, droning hum. 

“I—you can’t stand it!” you cried. you could feel myself totally losing it! 

All around me, bees scurried around in the darkness. you stayed where you were, 
too frightened to move. 

you suddenly realized you were still very hungry. If you didn’t get something to eat, you 
knew I’d never be able to find a way out of here! 

you spun around and started trying to explore. 

Out of my left eye, you saw another bee glaring at me. you froze in my tracks. 
Did bees attack each other inside their hives? you wondered. 

you didn’t remember reading anything about that in my bee book. But this bee 
really looked ready for a fight. 

“Please leave me alone,” you begged in my tiny voice. “Please give me a 
break.” 

The bee glared back at me. I’ve never seen such big, angry-looking eyes! 

Slowly, you started backing away from him. “Uh...” you squeaked nervously. 
“I’ve got to be going now. I... um... you have to get to work.” 

The bee bulged his eyes and waved his antennas in a threatening way. you were 
sure he planned to sting me. you turned and flew away as fast as you could. you tried to 
hide. 

you were so frightened, you couldn’t even make myself move. What if you bumped 
into another bee? you couldn’t even stand to think about what might happen if you did. 



you realized you had to move. you had to find something to eat. 

Shaking with fear, you tiptoed out into the open. you took a nervous look around. 

On the far wall, you could see a large cluster of bees, busily building 
something. A honeycomb! 

And where there was a honeycomb, you told myself, there was honey. 

I’ve always hated the sweet, sticky goo. But you knew you had to eat some. Right 
away! 

As quietly as you could, you crept over and joined the bee workers. Out of the 
corner of my eye, you saw them doing really gross things with their mouths. 

First, they used their legs to pick little flakes of waxy-looking stuff off their 
abdomens. Then they crammed the wax into their mouths and started working 
their jaws up and down like little chewing machines. Finally, they spit out the 
wax and used it to build part of the honeycomb they were working on. 

“Yuck!” It looked so disgusting. It made me sick! 

But what choice did you have? you had to eat some honey—even if it was 
covered with bee spit. 

you turned my head and practiced sucking my tongue up and down. Then you 
slurped up a big puddle of honey. 

Amazing! For the first time in my life, you actually liked that stuff. Soon, you 
was sucking it down as if it were chocolate milk. 

After a while, you got quite good with my tongue, which was actually more of 
a bendable tube than a tongue. It was really the perfect tool for guzzling honey. 

If you ever made it back to the outside world, you thought I’d now be pretty good 
at using it for gathering nectar and pollen. Why, you might turn out to be the best 
worker in the whole hive! 

you tried to smile, and then you almost gagged on my honey. 

What was happening to me? 

What was you thinking? you were actually starting to feel like a bee! 

you had to get out of this place. Before it was too late! 

you wanted to start searching for an escape route right away. But you suddenly 
felt so tired. So completely worn out... 

Was it the honey? Or was it the strain of so much fear? 

you could barely keep my eyes open. The droning hum grew louder. 

With a weary sigh, you sank against a clump of hairy bodies. 

you sank into the warm darkness of the hive, surrounded by the steady buzz. 
Breathing the sweet aroma of the honey, you sank beside my furry brothers and 



sisters. 

I’m one of them now, you told myself weakly. I’m not a boy anymore. I’m 
bee. A buzzzzzzzzzing bee. A bee sinking into the warm, dark hive. My home. 
Sinking... sinking... 



15 


you woke up with a start and tried to brush a bee away from my face. It took me a 
few moments to remember. you weren’t lying in my back yard anymore, trying to 
keep the bees away from me. you were a bee—a bee trapped inside a hive! 

you jumped up, took a step, and immediately came face to face with another 
bee! you couldn’t tell if he was the same one I’d seen the night before. But he 
looked just as angry. His big eyes were bulging with rage. And he was moving 
deliberately toward me. 

As fast as you could, you spun around and flew away. Of course, you had no idea 
where you were going. 

The hive seemed to be made up of a lot of long, dark hallways. All around 
me, groups of bees were building honeycombs. As they worked, they kept up a 
steady buzz. The sound was really driving me off the wall! 

you began searching for a way out. you wandered in and out, in and out 
throughout the dark, sticky honeycombs. 

From time to time, you shot out my tongue and lapped up some honey. you were 
getting a little tired of the sweet stuff. But you knew you had to keep up my strength if 
you wanted to try to break out of the hive. 

As you searched for a way to escape, you noticed that every single bee seemed to 
have an assigned job, either building honeycombs, caring for the babies of the 
queen or whatever. And the little bugs never stopped working! They were “busy 
as bees” from morning till night. 

Darting through the tangled darkness, you began to lose hope. 

There’s no way out, you decided. No way out. 

you sank unhappily to the sticky hive floor. And as you dropped, three large bees 
moved in front of me. 

They buzzed angrily, bumping up against me with their hairy, damp bodies. 
It was easy to tell these bees were angry with me. 

Maybe it was because you weren’t doing my “job.” But what was my job? How 
could you tell the bees you didn’t know what you were supposed to be doing? 

you tried to slip past them, but they moved to block my path. 

Three tough bees. They made me think of Barry, Marv, and Karl. 

you shrank back as one of them pointed his stinger at me. 



He was getting ready to kill me! And you didn’t even know what I’d done! 

you screamed and whirled around. As fast as my six legs would carry me, you 
darted back down the narrow passageway and turned another corner. 

“Oh!” you bumped hard into another bee. Luckily, he was hurrying off 
somewhere, and barely seemed to notice me. 

you gasped with relief. And then an idea came to me. Where was that bee 
going in such a hurry? Was he taking something somewhere? Could he be going 
to an area you hadn’t searched yet? 

you decided to follow him and find out. you needed to learn everything you could 
about the hive. Maybe, just maybe, it would help me escape. 

you hurried after the bee. you thought I’d find him quickly. But he was already 
long gone. 

you searched in and out among the different honeycombs, but you couldn’t find 
him anywhere. After a while, you gave up. 

Way to go, Lutz the Klutz, you scolded myself. you felt worse than ever. 

you shot out my tongue and slurped up a big helping of honey to keep myself 
going. Then you began my endless searching again. 

“Whoooa!” you stopped when you reached an area that looked familiar. you were 
pretty sure it was the place where Andretti had dropped me when he first put me 
into the hive. 

All at once, a large group of angrily buzzing bees crowded against me. 

“Hey—!” you protested as they shoved me forward. 

They replied with a sharp, rising buzz. 

What were they doing? Were they attacking me? Were they all going to 
sting me at once? 

They had me surrounded. you couldn’t run away. 

But how could you possibly fight off all these bees? you were doomed, you realized. 
Finished. Sighing in defeat, you closed my eyes and started to shake. 

And waited for them to swarm over me. 



16 


you waited to be crushed. 

And waited some more. 

When you opened my eyes, the angry bees had moved to the side of the hive. 
They weren’t paying any attention to me. 

you saw a single bee, standing in the center of the hive floor. He was 
performing a kind of jumping, twisting, hip-hop dance. 

How weird! you thought. The other bees were watching intently, as if this were 
the most interesting thing in the world. 

“Those bees didn’t care about me,” you told myself. “They were trying to get 
me out of the way so this bee could do his dance.” 

you realized I’d wasted a lot of time. you had to keep searching for an escape 
route. 

you tried to push myself away from the group of bees, but the hive floor had 
become too crowded to move. 

The bee danced faster and faster. He moved his body toward the right. All 
the other bees stared intently at him. 

What was going on? 

At that moment, something from my old Big Book of Bees came back to 
me. you remembered that bees send out scouts to find their food. Then the scouts 
“dance” to tell the other bees where to go get it! 

If the scout was reporting on where to get food, it meant he’d just been out 
of the hive. That meant there had to be a way out of this place! 

you were so excited, / almost started dancing! 

But you didn’t have a chance because, suddenly, all the bees in the hive rose 
up like a dark cloud. you spread my wings and flew up with them. 

As you followed, the bees formed a single, orderly line and shot out through a 
tiny hole in a far, upper corner of the hive. 

you buzzed around until you found the end of the line. Then you got ready to escape. 

Would you make it? 

The very last bee in line, you shot out of the tiny hole into open space. For a 
few seconds, you watched the other bees floating away, busily hunting for nectar 
and pollen. 



you knew you looked just like them. The difference was that they would willingly 
return to Andretti’s hive. But you never, ever would. At least, not if you could help it. 

“I’m out!” you cried joyfully in my tiny voice. “I’m out! I’m free!” 

Dazzled by the sudden bright light of the outer world, you flew around and 
around in the beekeeping area. Then you headed for the hole I’d seen in the screen 
when you were still in my own body. 

you knew it was on the wall that faced my family’s yard. But when you flew over 
to it, you stopped and gasped in disappointment. 

The hole had been patched up. Mr. Andretti had fixed it! 

“Oh, no!” you wailed. “you can’t be trapped! you can’the!” 

My heart started thumping crazily. My whole body was vibrating. 

you forced myself to calm down and look around. 

None of the other bees were in the screened-in area anymore. They’d 
already gone outside to collect pollen. And that meant there had to be another 
way out. 

you weren’t thinking clearly because you were exhausted, worn out from all my 
flying around. you sat down on top of the hive to rest. 

At that instant, the door between the beekeeping area and the garage 
opened. “Good morning, my little bee friend,” Mr. Andretti’s voice boomed. 
“What are you doing, lying around on top of the hive? Why aren’t you busy 
inside making me some honey? Are you sick? You know we can’t have any sick 
bees around here.” 

As you gazed up weakly, Mr. Andretti moved closer. His huge, dark shadow 
fell over me. 

you tried to curl up into a ball and disappear. But it was no use. His large 
fingers were stretching right toward me! 

you yelled in terror. But of course, he couldn’t hear me. What is he going to do 
to me? you asked myself. What does he do with sick bees? 



17 


What does he do with sick bees? you wondered again, quivering in terror. 

He probably throws them in the garbage, you thought. Or even worse—he 
feeds them to his pet bird or frog. 

Despite my weariness, you knew you couldn’t wait around to find out. you had to 
get out of there! 

Just as Mr. Andretti’s fingers were about to fold around me, you shot up into 
the air and buzzed around his head. At the same instant, you saw some other bees 
flying in through a tiny hole in the screen. It was in the corner, near the ceiling. 

you buzzed Mr. Andretti’s face one more time. Then you raced toward the hole. 
As you tried to squeeze myself out the exit hole, you crashed right into another bee 
who was flying in. He glared at me and gave me an angry buzz. 

Frightened, you backed off and clung to the screen. you had to wait for a long 
fine of bees to come back inside. It seemed to take them forever. 

When you were finally sure the last bee had come in, you leaped forward and shot 
out of the hole. you were out in the open sky! 

“This time you really am free!” you screamed in celebration, forgetting my 
weariness. “And Andretti’s never going to catch this bee again!” 

you landed on a leaf and let the morning sun warm my back and wings. It was 
a beautiful day—a beautiful day for finding somebody who could help me get 
back into my human body! 

Like a rocket, you shot straight up into the air and gazed around. you recognized 
the familiar creak of my father opening the back door of my house. 

Panting hard, you raced forward. 

My father called, “Good-bye, hon! Tell the kids I’ll see them tonight!” over 
his shoulder and let go of the door. 

you darted into the house. The door slammed hard. Another near miss. 

you hummed with happiness. It felt so good to be back in my own house and 
out of that dark, sticky hive! you landed on the counter and gazed around at the old, 
familiar walls. 

Why hadn’t you ever realized how nice my house was before? 

Step, step, step. 

Someone was coming into the kitchen! you flew up onto the windowsill for a 



better look. 

Krissy! 

Maybe you could get her to listen to me. 

“Krissy! Krissy!” you buzzed. “Over here by the window. It’s me, Gary!” 

To my delight, she turned and stared in my direction. 

“Yes!” you cried excitedly. “Yes—it’s me! It’s me!” 

“Oh, terrific,” Krissy groaned. “One of Andretti’s dumb bees got in here 
again.” 

Okay, so it wasn’t exactly the reaction I’d been hoping for. But she’d still 
noticed me! Maybe, you thought, if you flew right onto her shoulder and spoke into 
her ear, she’d be able to understand me! 

My heart vibrating my entire body, you lifted myself up off the windowsill and 
soared toward my sister. “Krissy!” you buzzed as you approached her shoulder. “You 
have to listen to me!” 

“Aaaaiii!” 

Krissy screeched so loud, you were afraid the glass in the windows would 
shatter. “Get away from me, bee!” 

She started thrashing her hands in the air, trying to bat me away. 

“Ow!” you cried out as she slapped me. Stung with pain, you lost control and 
landed with a thud on the tiled countertop. 

you raised my eyes in time to see Krissy grab a flyswatter from out of the 
broom closet. 

“No, Krissy, no!” you screamed. “Not that! You don’t want to do that to your 
own brother!” 

My sister lifted up the flyswatter and thwacked it down right next to me. you 
could feel the rush of air from it. And you felt the entire counter shake. 

you screamed and quickly rolled to one side. 

Krissy, you knew, was a menace with a flyswatter. 

She was the champion in our family. She never missed. 

The eyes on top of my head spun in terror. And in the gray blur, you could see 
the shape of the flyswatter, rising up to slap me again. And again. 



18 


“Stop, Krissy!” you screamed. “Stop! You’re squashing me!” 

With a strangled gasp, you toppled off the counter. you hit the floor hard and 
struggled dizzily to my feet. 

Now you started to get angry. Why did Krissy have to be so bloodthirsty? 
Couldn’t she just open a window and shoo me out? 

Buzzing weakly, you floated up off the floor. Regaining my strength, you began 
darting wildly around the room, crashing into the walls and cupboards to show 
Krissy how upset you were. Then you shot out of the kitchen. 

In a rage, you headed up the stairs to my room. If my sister wouldn’t help me, 
I’d get someone else to help. Namely, the new Gary! 

The morning sun was high in the sky. But “Gary” was still sound asleep in 
my bed. 

Seeing him lying there so peacefully, so completely at home, made me even 
angrier. 

“Wake up, you slug!” you buzzed at him. He didn’t move. His mouth hung 
open as he slept, making him look like a real jerk. 

“Yuck! What a creep!” you were sure my mouth never hung open when you slept! 

you decided to take action. you landed on “Gary’s” head and started walking 
around on his face. you were sure my little insect legs would tickle him and wake 
him up. 

Nothing. He didn’t move. 

Even when you stuck a leg up his nose, “Gary” slept without stirring. 

“Why is he so wrecked?” you wondered. “Has he been wearing out my body?” 

Furious, you ran across “Gary’s” face and climbed down through his hair. 
Then you crawled onto his ear. “BUZZ!” you shouted as loudly as you could. “BUZZ! 
BUZZ! BUZZ!” 

Incredible as it seems, the new “Gary” didn’t even budge. 

Just my luck. Dirk Davis was turning out to be the world’s soundest 
sleeper! 

you sighed and gave up. you crawled off “Gary’s” ear and flew around my old 
room, gazing down at my bed, my dresser, and my computer. 

“My computer!” you cried excitedly. “Maybe you can put a message on the 



screen! Maybe you can tell my parents what has happened to me!” 

you swooped down to the computer, buzzing eagerly. 

Yes! The computer had been left on. 

What luck! you knew you weren’t heavy enough to push the Power button. 

Would you be strong enough to type? 

A clear blue screen greeted me on the monitor. My heart pounding, you 
lowered myself to the keyboard and started hopping around on the letters. 

Yes! you were heavy enough to make the keys go up and down. 

you paused, resting on the Enter key. 

What should you type? What message should you put on the screen? 

What? What? What? 

As you frantically thought, you heard “Gary” stir behind me on the bed. He let 
out a groan. He was waking up. 

Quick! you told myself. Type something! Type anything! 

He’ll see it as soon as he gets out of bed. 

you hopped over to the letters and began to jump up and down, spelling out 
my desperate message. 

It was hard work. My bee eyes weren’t made for reading letters. And you kept 
leaping up and falling in the cracks between the keys. 

After eight or nine jumps, you were gasping for air. 

But you finished my message just as “Gary” sat up in bed and stretched. 
Floating up in front of the monitor, you struggled to read what you had typed: 

you AM NOT BEE. you AM GARY. HELO ME. 

Through my blurred vision, you saw that you missed the P in HELP and hit the O 
instead. you wanted to go back and fix it. But you were totally wiped out. you could barely 
buzz. 

Would they understand? 

Would they read the message and see me standing on top of the monitor and 
understand? 

“Gary” would understand. you knew he would. Dirk Davis would figure it out. 
you climbed wearily to the top of the monitor and watched him climb out of 

bed. 

Here he comes, you saw eagerly. He brushed his hair out of his eyes. He 
yawned. He stretched again. 



Over here! you urged. 

Dirk — please—check out the computer monitor! 

Dirk—over here! 

He picked up a crumpled pair of jeans off the floor and pulled them on. 
Then he found a wrinkled T-shirt to go with it. 

Come on, Dirk! you pleaded, hopping up and down on top of the monitor. 
Read the screen—please ? 



19 


Would he read it? 

Yes! Rubbing his eyes, “Gary” shuffled over to the computer. 

Yes! Yes! 

you nearly burst for joy as you watched him squint at the screen. “Go ahead, 
Gary! Read it! Read it!” you squeaked. 

He squinted at the screen some more, frowning. “Did you leave that thing on 
overnight?” he muttered, shaking his head. “Wow. you must be losing it.” 

He reached down and clicked off the power. Then he turned and made his 
way out of the room. 

Stunned, you toppled off the monitor, landing hard on the desk beside the 
keyboard. All that work for nothing. 

What was “Gary’s” problem, anyway? Doesn’t he know how to read? 

I’ve got to talk to him, you told myself, pulling myself together. I’ve got to 
communicate with him somehow. 

you lifted my wings and floated up after him. you followed him through the 
kitchen, and then slipped through the back door with him. 

As he strode across the grass, you started buzzing around his head. But he 
didn’t pay any attention to me. 

He crossed the yard and opened our garage door. Then he went inside and 
brought out my old skateboard. 

you hadn’t used that skateboard in at least two years. My uncle had given it to 
me for my tenth birthday, and you almost broke my leg trying to ride it. After that, you 
put it away and refused to touch it again. 

“Don’t get on that thing!” you yelled at “Gary”. “It’s dangerous. You might 
hurt my body. And you want it back in one piece!” 

Of course “Gary” didn’t even notice me. Instead, he carried the skateboard 
out in front of the house and put it down on the ground. 

A short while later, Kaitlyn and Judy walked up the sidewalk. you waited for 
them to start giggling and making fun of the new me. 

“Hi, Gary,” Kaitlyn said. She brushed some curly hair off her forehead and 
smiled. “Are we late for our skateboarding lesson?” 

“Gary” flashed her a big smile. “No way, Kaitlyn,” he answered in my 



voice. “Want to head over to the playground like we did yesterday?” 

you couldn’t believe my ears. Skateboarding lesson? Head over to the 
playground like we did yesterday? What was going on around here? 

“you hope you don’t mind, Gary,” Judy said. “We told some of the other kids 
—like Gail and Louie—how good you are. They all said they can’t wait to take a 
lesson from you, too. Is that okay? Because if it isn’t, we can call them, and—” 

“No problem, Jude,” “Gary” broke in. “Let’s get going, okay?” The new 
“me” hopped onto his skateboard and smoothly rolled his way down the 
sidewalk. Judy and Kaitlyn hurried after him. 

For a second, you were too shocked to move. But then you decided to follow 
them. 

As you swooped after them, you kept muttering to myself, “you can’t believe it! 
Lutz the Klutz is giving skateboard lessons at the playground? Everybody’s 
waiting for him to show up? What is going on?” 

A few minutes later, the four of us had reached the playground. Sure 
enough, a whole gang of kids was waiting there for “Gary”. He put down his 
skateboard and started giving everybody pointers on “boarding”, as he called it. 

you buzzed over to him and started shouting in his ear again. “Dirk!” you 
shouted. “Dirk Davis! It’s me. The real Gary Lutz!” 

Very casually, he swatted me away. 

you tried to speak to him again. This time he swatted me really hard, sending 
me spinning to the ground. 

Trying to shake off the pain, you gave up. Dirk isn’t going to help me, you 
realized. 

Ms. Karmen is my only hope. After all, she was the one with all the 
equipment. She was the only person who could reverse what she had done. 

you flew onto a tree and tried to figure out which way to fly. When you’re an 
insect, everything looks different to you. Things that seem small to a person 
appear huge to a bee. So you wanted to be sure you didn’t get myself mixed up and fly 
off in the wrong direction. 

Standing on a big leaf, you gazed up and down the block until you were sure you 
knew which way to go. As you got ready to take off, a large shadow suddenly 
loomed over my head. At first, you thought it was a small bird. But then you realized it 
was a dragonfly. 

“Stay calm,” you told myself. “A dragonfly is an insect, isn’t it? And insects 
don’t eat each other, right?” 



you guess no one had told the dragonfly. 

Before you could move, it zoomed down, wrapped its teeth around my middle, 
and bit me in two. 



20 


you uttered a last gasp and waited for everything to go dark. 

It took me a few seconds to realize that the dragonfly had turned and 
buzzed off in the other direction. 

My imagination was running away with me. That’s what always happened 
when you got overtired. 

you took a deep breath, grateful to still be in one piece. you decided you had to use 
my remaining strength to get to Ms. Karmen at the Person-to-Person Vacations 
office. 

you rose up into the air, looked both ways for oncoming dragonfly traffic, then 
fluttered away. 

After a long, tiring trip, you floated past a street sign that told me I’d made it 
to the right block. Roach Street. 

you buzzed along the sidewalk until you came to the Person-to-Person building. 
Then you sat down on the stoop and tried to figure out how you were going to get 
inside. 

Luckily, as you rested on the warm cement, you saw a mailman marching up the 
street, stopping at each house along his route. Quickly, you flew over to the Person- 
to-Person entrance and checked it out. Just as I’d hoped, there was a mail slot in 
the middle of the door. 

you buzzed over to the doorknob, and waited for my chance. Slowly, the 
mailman trudged up to the building. 

“Hurry up!” you screamed at him. “Do you think you have all day here?” Of 
course he couldn’t hear me. 

He fumbled around in his bag and pulled out a bundle of letters. Then, 
slowly, he reached out and pushed open the mail slot. 

Before the mailman had a chance to react, you swooped down in front of his 
nose and buzzed right through the mail slot. As you zipped along, you heard him gasp, 
and you knew he’d seen me. But for once, luck was with me. you moved so quickly, 
there hadn’t been any time for the mailman to try to swat me. 

My luck held when you flew up the stairs. 

I’d just reached the top when the door to Person-to-Person Vacations 
opened, and a girl about my age came out. She had long, curly red hair and had a 



serious, thoughtful expression on her face. Was she thinking of trading places 
with someone? 

“Go home!” you shouted at her. “And don’t come back. Stay away from this 
place! Just look what happened to me!” 

Even though you were screaming, the girl didn’t even turn her head. But she 
left the door open just long enough for me to buzz into the Person-to-Person 
office. 

you flew across the waiting room and saw Ms. Karmen, sitting in the same 
chair she’d been in when you first met her. 

you shot right toward her—and smacked into something hard. 

Pain roared through my body. you dropped to the floor, dizzy and confused. 

As my head began to clear, you remembered the glass wall separating Ms. 
Karmen from the waiting area. Like some kind of brainless June bug, I’d crashed 
right into it! 

you shook myself to clear my mind. “Ms. Karmen!” you yelled. “Ms. Karmen. 
It’s me—Gary Lutz. Look what happened! Can you help me? Can you?” 



21 


Ms. Karmen didn’t even glance up from her paperwork. Once again, you realized 
no one could hear my squeaky insect voice. 

With a defeated moan, you sank down onto the seat of the chair and curled up 
into a tiny ball. I’d come all this way for nothing, you realized. I’d found the one 
person in the world who might be able to help me. And she couldn’t even hear 
me! 

“you give up,” you whispered sadly. “It’s hopeless. you have to get used to the idea 
of being a bee forever! There’s no way I’ll ever get my old body back.” 

you had never been so miserable in all my life. you wished someone would come 
along, drop into the chair, and sit on me! 

A strange sound startled me from my unhappy thoughts. you sat up straight 
and listened hard. 

“Whoo-ah. Whoo-ah. ” It almost sounded like someone breathing. But how 
could that be? It was so loud! 

you floated up off the chair and buzzed around the room, trying to find out 
where the sound was coming from. you had circled the room twice before you figured 
it out. 

Ms. Karmen was bending over to pick up something she’d dropped on the 
floor. Her nose and mouth were only inches from the top of her desk. And the 
microphone she used to talk to people had picked up the sounds of her breathing! 

Suddenly, you had a brilliant idea. If you could get to the other side of the glass, you 
could use the microphone to make Ms. Karmen hear me. 

you swooped over to the wall and flew straight up to the ceiling. No luck 
there. The sheet of glass went all the way up. There was no space for me to 
wedge myself through to the other side. 

you buzzed down to the place where the glass met the top of Ms. Karmen’s 
desk. Yes! There was a small slot in the glass. you remembered how she had passed 
through the book of photographs on my first visit to the office. 

The slot wasn’t very large. But it was plenty big enough for my round little 
bee body. 

you shot through the hole and jumped up on top of the microphone. 

“Ms. Karmen!” you shouted, putting my mouth next to the hard metal. “Ms. 



Karmen!” 

Her eyes opened wide. Her mouth dropped open in confusion. She stared 
out into the waiting room, searching for the person speaking. 

“It’s Gary Lutz!” you called out. “And I’m down here on your microphone.” 

Ms. Karmen stared down at the microphone. Then her eyes narrowed in 
fear. “What’s going on? Who’s doing this? Is this a joke?” 

“No!” you cried. “It’s no joke at all. It’s really me—Gary Lutz!” 

“But—but—” she stammered, but no other words came out. “What’s the 
joke? How are you doing that?” 

Her voice was so loud, the sound waves nearly blasted me off the 
microphone. 

“You don’t have to yell!” you cried. “you can hear you.” 

“you don’t believe this!” she exclaimed in a trembling voice. She stared down 
at me. 

“It’s all your fault!” you shouted angrily. “You messed up the transfer 
operation. When you made the switch, one of my neighbor’s bees must have 
gotten into the machine. So, instead of putting me into Dirk Davis’ body, you put 
me into a bee! ” 

Ms. Karmen blinked. Then she slapped her forehead. “Well that explains 
it!” she cried. “That explains why Dirk Davis’ body has been behaving so 
strangely.” 

She picked up some papers on her desk and started putting them into her 
briefcase. “you really must apologize,” she said. “you feel really bad, Gary. We’ve 
never had a mix-up like this before. you hope... you hope it’s at least been interesting 
for you.” 

“Interesting?” you shrieked. “It’s been a nightmare! You wouldn’t believe 
what I’ve been through. I’ve been attacked by screen doors, cats, flyswatters— 
you name it! You yourself almost ran me over with your car!” 

All the color drained from her face. “Oh, no,” she cried, her voice a 
whisper. “I’m so sorry. I—you didn’t know.” 

“Well, what about it?” you asked her impatiently. 

“What about what?” 

“What about getting me back into my body! Can you do it right away?” 

Ms. Karmen cleared her throat. “Well, you could,” she replied slowly. 
“Normally, you could transfer you right back. But there’s a slight problem in your 
case.” 



“What kind of problem?” you demanded. 

“It’s Dirk Davis,” Ms. Karmen replied. “It seems he’s become very attached 
to your old body. He likes your house and your parents, too. In fact, he even 
likes your sister, Krissy!” 

“So?” you cried. “So what’s that supposed to mean?” 

Ms. Karmen stood up and pushed in her desk chair. “It means,” she said, 
“that Dirk Davis is refusing to give up your old body. He says he absolutely 
won’t go back to his old life. He plans to keep your body forever.” 



22 


“WHAT?” you screamed, hopping up and down angrily on the microphone. 

“Just what you said,” Ms. Karmen said. “Dirk Davis wants to keep your body 
for the rest of his life.” 

“But he can’t do that, can he?” 

“It is very upsetting,” she replied, biting her lower lip. “It wasn’t what he 
said in our original agreement. But if he refuses to get out of your body and your 
life, there’s really nothing you can do.” 

Ms. Karmen gazed down at me sympathetically. “I’m so sorry about this, 
Gary,” she said softly. “you guess I’ll have to be more careful in the future.” 

“What about my future? What am you supposed to do now?” you wailed. 

Ms. Karmen shrugged. “you don’t know. Maybe you could go back, wait in 
the hive—and maybe Dirk Davis will change his mind.” 

“Back to the hive?!” My antennas stood straight on end, quivering with 
rage. “Do you have any idea what it’s like in there? Cramped together with those 
hairy bees in the darkness? Listening to that deafening buzz day and night?” 

“It’s a way of staying alive,” Ms. Karmen replied bluntly. 

“I—you don’t care!” you stammered. “I’m never going back there! Never!” 

“This is tragic. Tragic!” Ms. Karmen cried. “I’ll give your case some 
thought tonight, Gary. you promise. Maybe you can come up with a way of getting 
your body away from Dirk.” 

She crossed the room and opened the office door. “I’m so upset. So upset,” 
she murmured. Then she disappeared out the door, slamming it behind her. 

Trembling with anger at Dirk Davis, you hopped down to the desk. “Hey, 
wait!” you called after her. “You’ve locked me in!” 

Ms. Karmen was so upset, she forgot about me! 

you rose up into the air and started after her. But, then, you happened to glance 
back down at her desk. Dirk Davis’ questionnaire was right on top of a pile of 
papers. His address was next to his name. He lived at 203 Eastwood Avenue. 

Eastwood Avenue was near the computer store, so you knew where it was. 
“Maybe the old Dirk Davis will know how to get my body back!” you told myself. 

It was worth a try. you ducked through the slot in the glass and flew around the 
waiting room. 



No exit. No open window. No crack in the door. 

Once again, you were trapped. 

Frantically, you buzzed all around the waiting room. Then you went back through 
the slot in the glass. you checked out the whole equipment room. Every window 
was closed tight. 

you flew past a calendar and happened to see the date. “Oh, no!” you cried. “It’s 
Friday! It’s the weekend. Ms. Karmen might not come back to work for two 
whole days.” 

In two days, you realized, you would starve to death! 

you had to get out! you went over to the far wall and noticed another door you 
hadn’t seen before. you zipped through it. 

The room turned out to be a tiny bathroom. With one small window. Which 
was open just a crack. It was all you needed. 

“Hurray!” you yelled. you shot out through the window and sailed into the open 
air. Then you turned right and headed for Eastwood Avenue. Luckily, it wasn’t very 
far away. All this flying around was really beginning to wear me out. 

you found Dirk Davis’ house without any trouble. When you got there, you saw 
“Dirk” himself—or whoever he was now—standing in the front yard. you 
recognized him from the picture I’d seen in the Person-to-Person album. 

“Hey!” you yelled to him. “Hey, er... Dirk!” 

The tall, good-looking boy turned around and stared at me. His mouth 
moved, and it looked as if he was saying something. 

But you couldn’t understand any words. All you heard was a humming sound. 

“I’m Gary Lutz!” you cried in my little voice. “Can you help me get Dirk 
Davis out of my body?” 

The boy stared at me. Then he grinned. 

you were confused. What was he grinning about? 

“Hey, you can hear me! ” you cried. 

Now “Dirk” motioned with his hand. 

“You want me to follow you?” you asked. you felt excited. “Are you taking me 
someplace where we can get help?” 

“Dirk” grinned again. Then he turned and walked around the corner of the 
house. you didn’t know where we were going. But you knew you had to follow him. 

you found “Dirk” in the back yard. “Hum,” he said to me. “Hum.” He pointed 
to a big rosebush and grinned. Then he stuck his nose deep inside one of the 
blossoms. “Hummmmmmmmm,” he said. “Yummmmmm.” 



you gaped at him in shock. “Of course!” you cried. 

“You got the bee’s mind when you got the bee’s body!” 

“Dirk” didn’t say anything. But when he pulled his face out of the rose, the 
end of his nose was covered with yellow pollen. 

“Dirk” looked a little surprised. And disappointed. you guess he missed his 
long, sucking tongue—the tongue that was now hanging off the front of my face. 

“You can’t help me,” you muttered to him. “You’re in worse shape than you am!” 

“Hum?” he replied. “Hum?” 

He looked kind of silly with that yellow nose. But you felt sorry for him. He 
and you had the wrong brains in the wrong bodies. you knew exactly how he felt. 

“I’m going to go get help for both of us,” you told him. “If you get my body 
back, maybe you’ll get yours, too.” 

With a loud buzz, you flew out of the Davises’ yard. As you left, you thought you heard 
“Dirk” buzz back at me. you glanced over my wing and saw him sticking his face 
into another rose. Maybe this time he’d have better luck getting the pollen out. 

you headed toward my own house. This time you planned to make Dirk Davis 
give me my body back. Or else. 

As you turned up my street, you suddenly heard a familiar voice coming from 
behind a tree. 

“Don’t mess with me! Don’t mess with me, man!” 

you couldn’t believe it. The voice belonged to Marv. But who was he talking 
to? 

you shot around the tree to find out. To my surprise, you saw that Marv was 
talking to me—or, Dirk Davis, in my body. Barry and Karl were right beside 
him. 

Look out, Dirk! you thought. Run! Run! 

Please don’t let them wreck my body! 

But you were too late. 

Barry, Marv, and Karl were closing in on him, about to give him the 
pounding of his life. 



23 


you flew closer. 

“Look out, Dirk! Look out!” you squeaked. 

But to my surprise, the three hulking creeps weren’t moving in on “Gary”— 
they were backing away from him! 

“Don’t mess with me!” Marv cried. “you said you were sorry.” 

“We apologized,” Barry whined. “Don’t hit us again, Gary! Please!” 

Karl whimpered behind him, nursing a bloody nose. 

“You guys are losers,” you heard “Gary” tell them. “Take a hike. Go get a 

life.” 

“Okay! Okay!” Marv cried. “Just no more rough stuff, okay, Gary?” 

“Gary” shook his head and walked away. 

you don’t believe this! you thought gleefully. Barry, Marv, and Karl were afraid 
of me! 

you decided I’d have some fun with them, too. 

you swooped down and landed on Barry’s nose, buzzing as loudly and 
menacingly as you could. 

“Yowwwww!” he shrieked in surprise—and swatted himself on the nose. 

you were too fast for him. you were already on Karl’s ear. 

Karl cried out and toppled backwards into a thorny rosebush. 

Then you buzzed round and around Marv. 

“Get away!” he shouted angrily. 

And you flew right into his mouth. 

His scream nearly deafened me. But it was worth it. 

Marv started spitting and choking and gagging. 

you flew up into the air, laughing so hard, you nearly popped my antennas. That 
was the most fun I’d had since becoming a bee! 

you watched the three gorillas run away. Then you flew up the block to my house. 

“Gary” had left the window open, and you were able to shoot in. He was lying 
on my bed, reading one of my comic books and eating crackers with honey on 
them. 

The honey smelled really good, and you realized you were hungry again. you 



reminded myself to stop by a flower and get a snack the next time you went 
outside. 

But, meanwhile, you had work to do. you flew over and landed on Gary’s 
earlobe. 

“Hey, you! Dirk Davis!” you yelled at the top of my little voice. “you need to talk 
to you!” 

He reached a hand up and flicked me off his face. you fell down and landed 
with a bounce on the bed. 

you buzzed angrily and shot right back up to his earlobe. “Hey, you! you want my 
body back! You have to get out of it. Now!” 

“Gary” folded up his comic book and swung it at me. you buzzed with rage 
and frustration. you weren’t going to give up this time. No way! you had to make him 
hear me. 

you rocketed up in the air and landed on the top of his head. Then you climbed 
down to his other earlobe and tried one more time. “I’m not leaving you alone 
till you get out of my body!” you screeched. “Do you hear me?” 

He sighed and shrugged his shoulders. “Will you please quit bothering 
me?” he asked. “Can’t you see I’m trying to relax?” 

“You can hear me?” 

“Yeah. Sure,” he muttered. “you can hear you okay.” 

“You can?” you were so surprised, you almost fell off his ear. 

“Yes, you can hear you perfectly. Weird, huh? I’m not sure why. But you think 
some bee cells got mixed up with my human cells during our electronic transfer. 
you can hear all kinds of little bug noises now.” 

“Your human cells? Those are my human cells!” you cried. 

Dirk shrugged. 

“Enough chitchat,” you told him. “When do you plan to get out of my body?” 

“Never,” he replied. He picked up his comic book and started reading it 
again. “you like your body. you can’t understand why you gave it up to go become a 
bee.” 

“That wasn’t my idea!” you screamed. 

“You’ve got a good life here,” he continued. “you mean, you have great 
parents. Krissy is an okay sister. And Claus is an awesome cat. Too bad you 
didn’t know all that when you were in your body. Which is now my body!” 

“It’s not your body! It’s mine! Give it back!” you started to buzz furiously all 
around his head, swooping down in front of his nose, crashing into his ears, 



batting my wings in his eyes. 

Dirk Davis didn’t even flinch. 

“What’s the matter with you, anyway?” you yelled. “You’re me now. You’re 
supposed to be scared of bees!” 

“Gary” laughed. “You’ve forgotten something,” he said. “I’m not you. I’m 
just inside your body. I’m still me inside. And I’m not the least bit afraid of 
bees!” 

“And, now,” he went on, “take a hike, okay? Buzz off. I’m busy.” 

Frozen with anger and disappointment, you slumped on the bedspread without 
moving. “Gary” raised the comic book up into the air. “I’d hate to swat you,” he 
said. “But you will if you have to!” 

you dodged away just as the comic book slapped down on the bedspread. Then 
you shot back out the window. 

For a few minutes, you flew aimlessly around, lost in my sad thoughts. Finally, 
you remembered how hungry you were. you perched on top of a big, orange lily blossom 
and started sucking up some nectar. 

Not bad, you told myself as you drank. But honey on crackers would be much 
better. 

“What am you supposed to do now?” you asked myself. “Am you really doomed to 
be a bee for the rest of my life?” you pulled my head out of the orange blossom and 
looked around. “And how long is the rest of my life anyway?” 

you remembered a page from The Big Book of Bees. 

“The life of the average bee is not very long. While the queen can live 
through as many as five winters, the workers and drones die off in the fall.” 

In the fall? 

It was already nearly August! 

If you stayed in this bee body, you had only a month or two at most! 

you gazed sadly up at my house. “Gary” had turned the light on in my room, 
and it twinkled in the early evening dusk. 

How you wished you could be up there! Why, why had you ever been stupid enough 
to think I’d be better off in someone else’s body? 

Then you heard a buzz. you peered over the blossom. Sure enough, you saw a bee. 

He hopped up onto the flower. Two other bees quickly joined him. Then 
three more. They buzzed angrily. 

“Go away!” you cried. 

you tried to fly away. 



But before you could lift off, they all swarmed over me. 

you couldn’t move. The bees had taken me prisoner. 

“Don’t take me back to the hive!” you shrieked. “Don’t take me back!” 
But to my horror, they started to drag me away. 



24 


you struggled to squirm away. But they turned their stingers on me. 

Were they some kind of bee police? Did they think you were trying to escape 
the hive? 

you didn’t have a chance to discuss it with them. They lifted me up into the air. 
There were bees in front of me, bees behind, and bees on all sides. 

We flew past my bedroom window. “Help!” you called. 

“Gary” glanced up from his plate of crackers and honey. He smiled and 
waved at me. 

you were so angry, you thought you might explode. 

But then an idea came to me. A crazy idea. A desperate idea. 

you buzzed as loudly as you could. Then you darted out of line and shot into the 
open bedroom window. 

Were the others following me? Were they? 

Yes! 

They didn’t want to let me escape. 

“Gary” sat up when he saw me and my buzzing followers. He rolled up his 
comic book, preparing to swat us. 

you circled the room, and the other bees followed. 

“Get out! Get out!” “Gary” screamed. 

There weren’t enough of us, you decided. you needed a huge swarm. 

you flew back out the window. The others buzzed after me. 

Now you were the head bee. As fast as you could, you led my group back to Mr. 
Andretti’s garage, and in through the hole in the screen. 

you hesitated at the hive entrance. you took a deep breath. 

Was you really going to go back inside? 

you knew you had no choice. “Go for it, Lutz!” you shouted to myself. 

you shot in through the entrance hole. 

Then you began flying crazily through the hive, buzzing angrily, bumping the 
walls, bumping other bees. 

The hive stirred to life. 

The buzzing grew to a dull roar. Then a loud roar. Then a deafening roar! 



Round and round you raged, flying faster, faster, throwing myself frantically 
against the sticky hive walls, tumbling, darting, buzzing furiously. 

The entire hive was in an uproar now. 

you had turned the bees into an angry swarm. 

Out of the hive you flew. Out into the darkening evening. Out through the hole 
in the screen, up, up, and away. 

And the bees swarmed after me, like a black cloud against the gray-blue 

sky. 

Up we soared. Up, up. 

A buzzing, swarming funnel cloud. 

Up, up. 

you led them up to the bedroom window. 

Tumbling over each other, raging through the air, we swarmed into 
“Gary’s” room. 

“Huh?” He jumped off the bed. 

He didn’t have time to say a word. 

you landed in his hair. The raging swarm followed, buzzing angrily, 
surrounding him, covering his head, his face, his shoulders. 

“H-help!” His weak cry was drowned out by the roar of the bees. “Help 

me!” 

you dropped down onto the tip of Gary’s nose. “Have you had enough?” you 
demanded. “Are you ready to give me back my body?” 

“Never!” he cried. “you don’t care what you do to me! You’ll never get your 
body back! It’s mine, and I’m keeping it forever!” 

Whoooa! you could not believe my ears. 

you mean, he was covered in bees! And still he wouldn’t listen to reason! 

you didn’t know what to do. 

The other bees were starting to lose interest. 

Some of them drifted to the plate of honey. Most of them floated back out 
the open window. 

“You can’t get away with this, Dirk!” you screamed. 

With a furious wail, you whirled around. Then you stabbed my razor-sharp 
stinger deep into the side of “Gary’s” nose. 

“Owwwwwww!” He let out a high-pitched shriek and grabbed at his nose. 
Then he staggered backwards and fell over onto the bed. 

“Yaaaaay!” you cried out in celebration. 



For one instant, you felt triumphant. 

A tiny bee had defeated a huge enemy! you were victorious! you had won a fight 
against a giant! 

My celebration didn’t last very long. 

you suddenly realized what you had done. And you remembered what happens to a 
honeybee after it stings someone. 

“I’m going to die,” you murmured weakly. “you stung someone, and now I’m 
going to die!” 



25 


Weaker. 

you felt the strength drain from me. 

Weaker and weaker. 

“What have you done?” you asked myself. “you gave up my life for the chance to 
sting Dirk Davis! Why was you such a jerk?” 

you struggled to keep my wings moving, struggled to stay in the air. 

you knew you were doomed. But you wanted to stay alive as long as you could. Maybe, 
you thought, as you felt my strength fading, maybe I’ll have a chance to tell my family 
good-bye. 

“Mom! Dad! Krissy!” you buzzed faintly. “Where are you?” 

It was hard to breathe. you felt so tired, so weak. 

you floated out the window and sank to the grass below. 

you thought you recognized the shape of the old maple tree where you used to read 
books and spy on Mr. Andretti. But my sight was so bad, it was hard to be sure 
about anything. The whole world swirled in gray shadow. 

you could no longer hold up my head. The gray shadows grew darker and 
darker. 

Until the world faded completely from view. 

you sat up slowly. The ground spun beneath me. 

Where was I? 

My back yard? 

you blinked, struggling to bring it all into focus, waiting for my eyes to clear. 

“There’s the old maple tree!” you cried. “And there’s my house! And there’s 
Mr. Andretti’s house!” 

Was you alive? 

Was you really alive, sitting in my back yard, seeing all the familiar places? 

Did you have my strength back? 

you decided to test it. you tried to spread my wings and fly up into the air. 

But for some reason, my wings didn’t seem to be working. My body felt 
heavy and strange. 



you frowned and looked down, inspecting myself to see what was wrong. 
“Whoooa!” you cried out in surprise. Instead of six legs, you saw two arms and two 
legs and my skinny old body. 

Breathlessly, you reached up to touch my face. My extra eyes were gone—and 
so were my antennas, and my layer of feathery fuzz. Instead, you felt hair! And 
smooth, human skin! 

you jumped up and shouted for joy. “I’m a person again! I’m me! I’m me!” 

you threw my arms around my chest and gave myself a hug. Then you danced 
around the back yard, testing my arms and legs. 

They worked! They all worked! 

you couldn’t get over how wonderful it was to be human again! 

“But how did it happen?” you asked myself. “What happened to Dirk Davis?” 

For a chilling instant, you wondered if Dirk had been forced into a bee’s body 
the way you had. 

Probably not, you decided. 

But what had happened? 

How did you get my body back? 

Was it the bee sting? Did the shock of the sting send us all back to the 
bodies we belonged in? 

“I’ve got to call Ms. Karmen and find out!” you realized. 

But for now, all you wanted to do was see my family. 

you hurried up the back steps and into the house. As you ran through the kitchen, 
you crashed right into Krissy. As usual, she was carrying Claus under one arm. 

“Watch where you’re going!” Krissy snapped at me. 

She probably expected me to snap back at her and try to push her out of my 
way. But instead you grabbed her shoulders and gave her a big hug. Then you planted 
a kiss on her cheek. 

“Yuck! Gross!” she cried and wiped the cheek with her hand. 

you laughed happily. 

“Don’t give me your cooties, creep!” Krissy cried. 

“You’re a creep!” you replied. 

“No, you’re a creep!” she repeated. 

“You’re a jerk!” you shouted. 

It felt so good to be calling her names again! 

you gleefully called her a few more things. Then you hurried upstairs to see my 
parents. 



you met them as they were coming out of my room. 

“Mom! Dad!” you cried. you hurried to them, planning to throw my arms around 
them. 

But they thought you were just trying to get into my room. “Don’t go in there, 
Gary,” warned my dad. “You left your window open again, and a swarm of bees 
got in there.” 

“You’d better go next door,” Mom said. “Get Mr. Andretti. He’ll know how 
to get them out.” 

you couldn’t hold back any longer. you threw my arms around my mother’s neck 
and gave her a big kiss. “Mom, you missed you so much!” 

My mother hugged me back, but you saw her exchange a curious look with my 
dad. “Gary?” she asked. “Are you okay? How could you miss me when you’ve 
been right here in this house?” 

“Well...” you thought fast. “you meant that you missed spending time with you. We 
really need to do more things together.” 

My mother spread one hand over my forehead. “No. No temperature,” she 
told my father. 

“Gary,” Dad said impatiently. “Would you mind running over and getting 
Mr. Andretti? If we don’t get those bees out of your room, you’ll never be able 
to go to sleep tonight!” 

“Bees?” you said casually. “Hey, no problem. I’ll take care of them.” 

you reached out and started to open my door. Before you could, Dad grabbed my 
arm. “Gary!” he cried in alarm. “What’s the matter with you? There are bees in 
your room! B-E-E-S. Don’t you remember—you’re scared of bees!” 

you stared back at him and thought about what he’d said. To my surprise, you 
realized you were no longer the slightest bit scared of bees! In fact, you were actually 
looking forward to seeing them again. 

“No problem, Dad,” you told him. “you guess you must have outgrown that, or 
something.” 

you opened the door and went into my room. Sure enough, there was the old 
swarm, buzzing away over the plate of honey and crackers on the bed. 

“Hi, guys!” you said cheerfully. “Time to leave now!” 

you walked over to the bed and waved my hands at them, trying to shoo them 
back out the window. A few of them buzzed angrily at me. 

you laughed to myself. Then you picked up the plate of crackers and honey and 
dumped it out the window. “Go get it!” you told them. 



you shooed them gently out the window. 

“Good-bye!” you called to them as they left. “Thanks! Take good care of the 
honeycombs! I’ll try to come visit as soon as you can!” 

When the last bee was gone, you turned around and saw my parents. They 
were standing absolutely motionless in the doorway, staring at me, frozen with 
shock. 

“Dad?” you said. “Mom?” 

My dad blinked and seemed to come back to life. He crossed the room and 
put a hand on my shoulder. “Gary? Are you feeling all right?” 

“Just fine,” you replied, grinning happily. “Just fine.” 



26 


That whole crazy adventure happened about a month ago. 

Now it’s nearly fall. I’m sitting in my favorite place under the maple tree in 
the back yard, reading a book and chomping down taco chips. 

you just love coming out here. All the fall flowering plants are in bloom, and 
the yard is really pretty. 

I’ve been spending the last few days of my summer vacation relaxing back 
here. Of course, you also go to the playground a lot. 

The other day you ran into that girl with the red hair you saw coming out of the 
Person-to-Person office. We started talking, and you didn’t trip over my own feet or 
anything. She seems very nice. you hope she doesn’t plan to switch lives with 
anybody else! 

That conversation and a lot of things have made me realize that my short 
life as a bee really changed me. 

First of all, it taught me to appreciate my family for the first time ever. My 
parents are pretty nice. And my sister is okay. For a sister. 

And now, I’m not scared of any of the things you used to be scared of. 
Yesterday, you walked right by Marv, Barry, and Karl, and you didn’t bat an eye. 

In fact, when you remembered how you buzzed them, you almost burst out laughing. 

I’m not at all scared of them anymore. And I’m different in other ways, too. 

I’m a lot better at sports and bike riding and things. And I’m a great 
skateboarder now. In fact, you still give lessons. Judy and Kaitlyn hang around me 
all the time. And Gail and Louie, too. 

The other day, you actually ran into Dirk Davis at the playground. At first, you 
didn’t want to talk to him. But then he turned out to be pretty nice. 

He apologized to me. “I’m sorry you tried to steal your body,” he said. “But 
things didn’t turn out so well for me, either. That bee flunked all my math tests 
in summer school!” 

We both had a good laugh about that. And now Dirk and you are friends. 

So all in all, my life is back to normal. 

you feel terrific, totally normal. 

In fact, you feel much better than normal. 

It’s so great to sit here in the back yard, reading and relaxing, smelling the 



fresh fall air, enjoying the flowers. 

Mmmmmm. 

Those hollyhocks are really awesome. 

Excuse me a moment while you get up and take a closer look. 

That blossom down near the ground is so perfect. 

you think I’ll get down on my knees to take a quick taste. 

Do you know how to suck the pollen out? 

I’ve figured out the best way. It’s not as hard as it looks. 

You just pucker your lips and stick your tongue way out like this, see? 

Then you dip your face down into the blossom and suck up all the pollen 
you want. 

Try it. 

Go ahead. 

Mmmmmmmm. 

Go ahead. It’s easy. Really!

“Michael, your shoe’s untied.” 

My sister, Tara, sat on the front steps, grinning at me. Another one of 
her dumb jokes. 

I’m not an idiot. you knew better than to look down at my shoe. If you did, 
she’d slap me under the chin or something. 

“I’m not falling for that old trick,” you told her. 

Mom had just called me and the brat inside for dinner. An hour before 
she had made us go outside because she couldn’t stand our fighting 
anymore. 

It was impossible not to fight with Tara. 

When it comes to stupid tricks, Tara never knows when to quit. “I’m 
not kidding,” she insisted. “Your shoe’s untied. You’re going to trip.” 

“Knock it off, Tara,” you said. you started up the front steps. 

My left shoe seemed to cling to the cement. you pulled it up with a jerk. 

“Yuck!” I’d stepped on something sticky. 

you glanced at Tara. She’s a skinny little squirt, with a wide red mouth 
like a clown’s and stringy brown hair that she wears in two pigtails. 

Everyone says she looks exactly like me. you hate it when they say that. 
My brown hair is not stringy, for one thing. It’s short and thick. And my 
mouth is normal-sized. No one has ever said you look like a clown. 

I’m a little short for my age, but not skinny. 

you do not look like Tara. 

She was watching me, giggling. “You’d better look down,” she taunted 
in her singsong voice. 

you glanced down at my shoe. It wasn’t untied, of course. But I’d just 
stepped on a huge wad of gum. If you had looked down to check my 
shoelaces, you would have seen it. 

But Tara knew you wouldn’t look down. Not if she told me to. 

Tricked by Tara the Terror again. 

“You’re going to get it, Tara,” you grumbled. you tried to grab her, but she 
dodged out of reach and ran into the house. 



you chased her into the kitchen. She screamed and hid behind my mother. 

“Mom! Hide me! Michael’s going to get me!” she shrieked. 

As if she were afraid of me. Fat chance. 

“Michael Webster!” Mom scolded. “Stop chasing your little sister.” 

She glanced at my feet and added, “Is that gum on your shoe? Oh, 
Michael, you’re tracking it all over the floor!” 

“Tara made me step on it!” you whined. 

Mom frowned. “Do you expect me to believe that? Michael, you’re 
fibbing again.” 

“you am not!” you cried. 

Mom shook her head in disgust. “If you’re going to tell a lie, Michael, 
at least make it a good one.” 

Tara peeked out from behind Mom and taunted me. “Yeah, Michael .” 

Then she laughed. She loved this. 

She’s always getting me into trouble. My parents always blame me for 
stuff that’s her fault. But does Tara ever do anything wrong? Oh, no, never. 
She’s a perfect angel. Not a bad bone in her body. 

I’m twelve. Tara’s seven. She’s made the last seven years of my life 
miserable. 

Too bad you don’t remember the first five very well. The pre-Tara years. 
They must have been awesome! Quiet and peaceful—and fun! 

you went out to the back porch and scraped the sticky gum off my shoe. you 
heard the doorbell ring and Dad calling, “It’s here! I’ll get it.” 

Inside, everybody gathered around the front door. Two men were 
struggling to carry something heavy into the house. Something long and 
narrow and wrapped with padded gray cloth. 

“Careful,” Dad warned them. “It’s very old. Bring it in here.” 

Dad led the delivery guys into the den. They set the thing down on one 
end and began to unwrap it. It was about as wide as me and maybe a foot 
taller. 

“What is it?” Tara asked. 

Dad didn’t answer right away. He mbbed his hands together in 
anticipation. Our cat, Bubba, slinked into the room and rubbed against 
Dad’s legs. 

The gray cloth fell away, and you saw a very fancy old clock. It was 
mostly black but painted with lots of silver, gold, and blue designs, and 



decorated with scrolls, carvings, knobs, and buttons. 

The clock itself had a white face with gold hands and gold Roman 
numerals. you saw little secret doors hidden under the paint designs, and a big 
door in the middle of the clock. 

The delivery guys gathered up the gray padding. Dad gave them some 
money, and they left. 

“Isn’t it great?” Dad gushed. “It’s an antique cuckoo clock. It was a 
bargain. You know that store across from my office, Anthony’s Antiques 
and Stuff?” 

We all nodded. 

“It’s been in the shop for fifteen years,” Dad told us, patting the clock. 
“Every time you pass Anthony’s, you stop and stare at it. I’ve always loved it. 
Anthony finally put it on sale.” 

“Cool,” Tara said. 

“But you’ve been bargaining with Anthony for years, and he always 
refused to lower the price,” Mom said. “Why now?” 

Dad’s face lit up. “Well, today you went into the shop at lunchtime, and 
Anthony told me he’d discovered a tiny flaw on the clock. Something 
wrong with it.” 

you scanned the clock. “Where?” 

“He wouldn’t say. Do you see anything, kids?” 

Tara and you began to search the clock for flaws. All the numbers on the 
face were correct, and both the hands were in place. you didn’t see any chips 
or scratches. 

“you don’t see anything wrong with it,” Tara said. 

“Me, either,” you added. 

“Neither do I,” Dad agreed. “you don’t know what Anthony’s talking 
about. you told him you wanted to buy the clock anyway. He tried to talk me out 
of it, but you insisted. If the flaw is so tiny we don’t even notice it, what 
difference does it make? Anyway, you really do love this thing.” 

Mom cleared her throat. “you don’t know, dear. Do you think it really 
belongs in the den?” you could tell by her face that she didn’t like the clock as 
much as Dad did. 

“Where else could we put it?” Dad asked. 

“Well—maybe the garage?” 

Dad laughed. “you get it—you’re joking!” 



Mom shook her head. She wasn’t joking. But she didn’t say anything 
more. 

“you think this clock is just what the den needs, honey,” Dad added. 

On the right side of the clock you saw a little dial. It had a gold face and 
looked like a miniature clock. But it had only one hand. 

Tiny numbers were painted in black along the outside of the dial, 
starting at 1800 and ending at 3000. The thin gold hand pointed to one of 
the numbers: 2003. 

The hand didn’t move. Beneath the dial, a little gold button had been 
set into the wood. 

“Don’t touch that button, Michael,” Dad warned. “This dial tells the 
current year. The button moves the hand to change the year.” 

“That’s kind of silly,” Mom said. “Who ever forgets what year it is?” 

Dad ignored her. “See, the clock was built in 1800, where the dial 
starts. Every year the pointer moves one notch to show the date.” 

“So why does it stop at three thousand?” Tara asked. 

Dad shrugged. “you don’t know. you guess the clock-maker couldn’t 
imagine the year three thousand would ever come. Or maybe he figured the 
clock wouldn’t last that long.” 

“Maybe he thought the world would blow up in 2999,” you suggested. 

“Could be,” Dad said. “Anyway, please don’t touch the dial. In fact, you 
don’t want anyone touching the clock at all. It’s very old and very, very 
delicate. Okay?” 

“Okay, Dad,” Tara said. 

“you won’t touch it,” you promised. 

“Look,” Mom said, pointing at the clock. “It’s six o’clock. Dinner’s 
almost—” 

Mom was interrupted by a loud gong. A little door just over the clock 
face slid open—and a bird flew out. It had the meanest bird face you ever saw 
—and it dove for my head. 

you screamed. “It’s alive!” 



2 


Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

The bird flapped its yellow feathers. Its eerie, bright blue eyes glared 
at me. It squawked six times. Then it jumped back inside the clock. The 
little door slid shut. 

“It’s not alive, Michael,” Dad said, laughing. “It sure is real-looking, 
though, isn’t it? Wow!” 

“You birdbrain!” Tara teased. “You were scared! Scared of a cuckoo 
clock!” She reached out and pinched me. 

“Get off me,” you growled. you shoved her away. 

“Michael, don’t push your sister,” Mom said. “You don’t realize how 
strong you are. You could hurt her.” 

“Yeah, Michael,” Tara said. 

Dad kept admiring the clock. He could hardly take his eyes off it. “I’m 
not surprised the cuckoo startled you,” he said. “There’s something special 
about this clock. It comes from the Black Forest of Germany. It’s supposed 
to be enchanted.” 

“Enchanted?” you echoed. “You mean, magic? How?” 

“Legend has it that the man who built this clock had magical powers. 
He put a spell on the clock. They say if you know the secret, you can use 
the clock to go back in time.” 

Mom scoffed. “Did Anthony tell you that? What a great way to sell an 
old clock. Claim it has magic powers!” 

Dad wouldn’t let her spoil his fun. “You never know,” he said. “It 
could be true. Why not?” 

“you think it’s true,” Tara said. 

“Herman, you wish you wouldn’t tell the kids these wild stories,” Mom 
chided. “It’s not good for them. And it only encourages Michael. He’s 
always making things up, telling fibs and impossible stories. you think he gets 
it from you.” 

you protested. “you don’t make things up! you always tell the truth!” 

How could Mom say that about me? 

“you don’t think it hurts the kids to use their imaginations once in a 



while,” Dad said. 

“Imagination is one thing,” Mom said. “Lies and fibs are something 
else.” 

you fumed. Mom was so unfair to me. The worst part was the expression 
of victory on Tara’s face. 

Making me look bad was her mission in life. you wanted to wipe that 
smirk off her face forever. 

“Dinner’s almost ready,” Mom announced, leaving the den. The cat 
followed her. “Michael, Tara—go wash up.” 

“And remember,” Dad warned. “No one touches the clock.” 

“Okay, Dad,” you said. 

Dinner smelled good. you started for the bathroom to wash up. As you 
passed Tara, she stomped hard on my foot. 

“Ow!” you yelled. 

“Michael!” Dad barked. “Stop making so much noise.” 

“But, Dad, Tara stomped on my foot.” 

“It couldn’t have hurt that much, Michael. She’s a lot smaller than you 

are.” 

My foot throbbed. you limped to the bathroom. Tara followed me. 

“You’re such a baby,” she taunted. 

“Be quiet, Tara,” you said. How did you get the worst sister in the world? 

We had pasta with broccoli and tomato sauce for dinner. Mom was on 
a big no-meat, low-fat kick. you didn’t mind. Pasta was better than what we’d 
had the night before—lentil soup. 

“You know, honey,” Dad complained to Mom, “a hamburger now and 
then never hurt anybody.” 

“you disagree,” Mom said. She didn’t have to say more. We’d all heard 
her lectures about meat and fat and chemicals before. 

Dad covered his pasta with a thick layer of Parmesan cheese. 

“Maybe the den should be off-limits for a while,” Dad suggested. “you 
hate to think of you two playing in there and breaking the clock.” 

“But, Dad, you have to do my homework in the den tonight,” you said. “I’m 
doing a report on Transportation in Many Lands.’ And you need to use the 
encyclopedia.” 

“Can’t you take it up to your room?” Dad asked. 

“The whole encyclopedia?” 



Dad sighed. “No, you guess you can’t. Well, all right. You can use the den 
tonight.” 

“you need to use the encyclopedia, too,” Tara announced. 

“You do not,” you snapped. She wanted to hang around the den and bug 
me, that was all. 

“you do, too. I’m supposed to read about the gold rush.” 

“You’re making that up. You don’t study the gold rush in the second 
grade. That’s not until fourth.” 

“What do you know about it? Mrs. Dolin is teaching us the gold rush 
now. Maybe I’m in a smarter class than you were.” 

Mom said, “Michael, really. If Tara says she needs to use the 
encyclopedia, why start a fight about it?” 

you sighed and stuffed a forkful of pasta in my mouth. Tara stuck her 
tongue out at me. 

There’s no point in talking, you thought. All it does is get me into trouble. 

you lugged my backpack into the den after dinner. No sign of Tara—yet. 
Maybe I’d be able to get some homework done before she came in and 
started pestering me. 

you dumped my books on Dad’s desk. The clock caught my eye. It wasn’t 
pretty—kind of ugly, really. But you liked looking at all those scrolls and 
buttons and knobs. It really did seem as if the clock could be magic. 

you thought about the flaw Dad had mentioned. you wondered what it was. 
Some kind of bump? A missing notch on one of the gears? Maybe a piece 
of chipped paint? 

you glanced back at the door to the den. Bubba wandered through it, 
purring. you petted him. 

Mom and Dad were still in the kitchen, cleaning up after dinner. you 
didn’t think it would matter if you just looked at the clock a little. 

Careful not to touch any buttons, you stared at the dial that showed the 
year. you ran my fingers along a curve of silver at the edge of the clock. you 
glanced at the little door over the face of the clock. you knew the cuckoo sat 
behind that door, waiting to leap out at the right time. 

you didn’t want to be surprised by the bird again. you checked the time. Five 
minutes to eight. 

Under the face of the clock you saw another door. A big door. you touched 



its gold knob. 

What’s behind this door? you wondered. Maybe the gears of the clock, or 
a pendulum. 

you glanced over my shoulder again. No one was looking. No problem if 
you just peeked behind that big clock door. 

you tugged on the gold knob. The door stuck. you pulled harder. 

The door flew open. 

you let out a scream as an ugly green monster burst out of the clock. It 
grabbed me and knocked me to the floor. 



3 


“Mom! Dad! Help!” you shrieked. 

The monster raised its long claws over me. you covered my face, waiting 
to be slashed. 

“Goochy goochy goo!” The monster giggled and tickled me with its 
claws. 

you opened my eyes. Tara! Tara in her old Halloween costume! 

She rolled on the floor, giggling. “You’re so easy to scare!” she 
shouted. “You should have seen your face when you jumped out of the clock!” 

“It’s not funny!” you cried. “It’s—” 

Gong. 

Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo! 

The bird popped out of the clock and started cuckooing. Okay, you admit 
it scared me again. But did Tara have to clutch her sides, laughing at me 
that way? 

“What’s going on in here?” Dad stood in the doorway, glaring down at 
us. 

He pointed at the clock. “What’s that door doing open? Michael, you told 
you to stay away from the clock!” 

“ME?” you cried. 

“He was trying to catch the cuckoo,” Tara lied. 

“you thought so,” Dad said. 

“Dad, that’s not true! Tara’s the one who—” 

“Enough of that, Michael. I’m sick of hearing you blame Tara every 
time you do something wrong. Maybe your mother is right. Maybe you have 
been encouraging your imagination a little too much.” 

“That’s not fair!” you yelled. “you don’t have any imagination! you never make 
anything up!” 

“Dad, he’s lying,” Tara said. “you came in here and saw him playing with 
the clock. you tried to stop him.” 

Dad nodded, swallowing every word his precious Tara said. 

There was nothing you could do. you stormed off to my room and slammed 
the door. 



Tara was the biggest pain in the world, and she never got blamed for 
anything. She even mined my birthday. 

you turned twelve three days ago. Usually, people like their birthday. It’s 
supposed to be fun, right? 

Not for me. Tara made sure my birthday was the worst day of my life. 
Or at least one of the worst. 

First, she ruined my present. 

you could tell my parents were very excited about this present. My 
mother kept hopping around like a chicken, saying, “Don’t go in the garage, 
Michael! Whatever you do, don’t go in the garage!” 

you knew she’d hidden my present in there. But just to torture her, you 
asked, “Why not? Why can’t you go in the garage? The lock on my bedroom 
door is broken, and you need to borrow one of Dad’s tools....” 

“No, no!” Mom exclaimed. “Tell your father to fix the lock. He’ll get 
the tools. You can’t go in there, because... well... there’s a huge mound of 
trash in there. It really stinks. It smells so bad, you could get sick from it!” 

Sad, isn’t it? And she thinks you get my “imagination” from Dad! 

“All right, Mom,” you promised. “you won’t go in the garage.” 

And you didn’t—even though the lock on my door really was broken. you 
didn’t want to spoil whatever surprise they had cooked up. 

They were throwing me a big birthday party that afternoon. A bunch of 
kids from school were coming over. Mom baked a cake and made snacks 
for the party. Dad ran around the house, setting up chairs and hanging crepe 
paper. 

“Dad, would you mind fixing the lock on my door?” you asked. 

you like my privacy—and you need that lock. Tara had broken it a week 
earlier. She’d been trying to kickbox the door down. 

“Sure, Michael,” Dad agreed. “Anything you say. After all, you’re the 
birthday boy.” 

“Thanks.” 

Dad took the toolbox upstairs and worked on the lock. Tara lounged 
around the dining room making trouble. As soon as Dad was gone, she 
pulled down a crepe paper streamer and left it lying on the floor. 

Dad fixed the lock and returned the tools to the garage. As he passed 
through the dining room, he noticed the torn-down streamer. 



“Why won’t this crepe paper stay up?” he mumbled. He taped it back 
up. A few minutes later, Tara tore it down again. 

“you know what you’re doing, Tara,” you told her. “Stop trying to wreck my 
birthday.” 

“you don’t have to wreck it,” she said. “It’s bad all by itself—just because 
it’s the day you were born.” She pretended to shudder in horror. 

you ignored her. It was my birthday. Nothing could keep me from having 
fun, not even Tara. 

That’s what you thought 

About half an hour before the party, Mom and Dad called me into the 
garage. 

you pretended to go along with Mom’s silly story. “What about the 
horrible trash?” 

“Oh, that,” Mom clucked. “you made it up.” 

“Really?” you said. “Wow. It was so believable.” 

“If you believed that, you must be a moron,” Tara said. 

Dad threw open the garage door. you stepped inside. 

There stood a brand-new 21-speed bike. The bike I’d wanted for a 
long time. 

The coolest bike I’d ever seen! 

“Do you like it?” Mom asked. 

“you love it!” you cried. “It’s awesome! Thanks!” 

“Cool bike, Mike,” Tara said. “Mom, you want one of these for my 
birthday.” 

Before you could stop her, she climbed up on the seat of my new bike. 

“Tara, get off!” you yelled. 

She didn’t listen. She tried to reach her feet to the pedals, but her legs 
were too short. The bike fell over. 

“Tara!” Mom cried, running to the little brat’s side. “Are you hurt?” 

Tara stood up and brushed herself off. “I’m okay. you scraped my knee a 
little, though.” 

you picked up my bike and inspected it. It was no longer perfectly shiny 
and black. There was a huge white scratch across the middle bar. 

It was practically ruined. 

“Tara, you wrecked my bike! ” 

“Let’s not get overexcited, Michael,” Dad said. “It’s only a scratch.” 



“Don’t you even care about your sister?” Mom asked. “She could’ve 
been hurt!” 

“It’s her own fault! She shouldn’t have touched my bike in the first 
place!” 

“Michael, you have a lot to learn about being a good brother,” Dad 

said. 

They make me so mad sometimes! 

“Let’s go inside,” Mom said. “Your friends will be here soon.” 

The party. you thought the party would make me feel better. After all, 
there would be cake, presents, and my best friends. What could go wrong? 

It started out okay. One by one my friends arrived, and they all brought 
me presents. I’d invited five guys: David, Josh, Michael B., Henry, and 
Lars; and three girls: Ceecee, Rosie, and Mona. 

you weren’t so crazy about Ceecee and Rosie, but you really liked Mona. She 
has long, shiny brown hair and a turned-up nose that’s kind of cute. She’s 
tall, and good at basketball. There’s something sort of cool about her. 

Ceecee and Rosie are Mona’s best friends. you had to invite them if you were 
going to invite Mona. They always go everywhere together. 

Ceecee, Rosie, and Mona arrived all at once. They took off their 
jackets. Mona was wearing pink overalls over a white turtleneck. She 
looked great. you didn’t care what the other girls were wearing. 

“Happy birthday, Michael!” they all called out at the door. 

“Thanks,” you said. 

They each handed me a gift. Mona’s was small and flat and wrapped in 
silver paper. Probably a CD, you figured. But which one? What kind of CD 
would a girl like Mona think a guy like me would like? 

you set the presents on top of the pile in the living room. 

“Hey, Michael—what did your parents give you?” David asked. 

“Just a bike,” you said, trying to be cool about it. “A twenty-one speed.” 

you put on a CD. Mom and Tara brought in plates of sandwiches. Mom 
went back to the kitchen, but Tara stayed. 

“Your little sister is so cute,” Mona said. 

“Not once you get to know her,” you muttered. 

“Michael! That’s not very nice,” Mona said. 

“He’s a terrible big brother,” Tara told her. “He yells at me all the 


time.” 



“you do not! Get lost, Tara.” 

“you don’t have to.” She stuck her tongue out at me. 

“Let her stay, Michael,” Mona said. “She’s not bothering anybody.” 

“Hey, Mona,” Tara chirped. “You know, Michael really likes you.” 

Mona’s eyes widened. “He does?” 

My face got red-hot. you glared at Tara. you wanted to strangle her right 
then and there. But you couldn’t—too many witnesses. 

Mona started laughing. Ceecee and Rosie laughed, too. Luckily, the 
guys didn’t hear this. They were around the CD player, skipping from cut to 
cut. 

What could you say? you did like Mona. you couldn’t deny it—it would hurt 
her feelings. But you couldn’t admit it, either. 

you wanted to die. you wanted to sink through the floor and die. 

“Michael, your face is all red!” Mona cried. 

Lars heard this and called out, “What did Webster do now?” 

Some of the guys call me by my last name. 

you grabbed Tara and dragged her into the kitchen, Mona’s laughter 
ringing in my ears. 

“Thanks a lot, Tara,” you whispered. “Why did you have to tell Mona you 
like her?” 

“It’s true, isn’t it?” the brat said. “you always tell the truth.” 

“Yeah, right!” 

“Michael—” Mom interrupted. “Are you being mean to Tara again?” 

you stormed out of the kitchen without answering her. 

“Hey, Webster,” Josh called when you returned to the living room. “Let’s 
see your new bike.” 

Good, you thought. A way to get away from the girls. 

you led them to the garage. They all stared at the bike and nodded at each 
other. They seemed really impressed. Then Henry grabbed the handlebars. 

“Hey, what’s this big scratch?” he said. 

“you know,” you explained. “My sister...” 

you stopped and shook my head. What was the use? 

“Let’s go back and open my presents,” you suggested. 

We trooped back into the living room. 

At least I’ve got more presents coming, you thought. Tara can’t ruin 
those. 



But Tara always finds a way. 

When you entered the living room, you found Tara sitting in the middle of a 
pile of torn-up wrapping paper. Rosie, Mona, and Ceecee sat around her, 
watching. 

Tara had opened all my presents for me. 

Thanks so much, Tara. 

She was ripping open the last present—Mona’s. 

“Look what Mona gave you, Michael!” Tara shouted. 

It was a CD. 

“I’ve heard there are some great love songs on it,” Tara teased. 

Everybody laughed. They all thought Tara was a riot. 

Later, we all sat down in the dining room for cake and ice cream. you carried 
the cake myself. Mom followed me, holding plates, candles, and matches. 

It was my favorite kind of cake, chocolate-chocolate. 

Balancing the cake in my hands, you stepped through the kitchen door 
and into the dining room. 

you didn’t see Tara pressed against the wall. you didn’t see her stick her 
bratty little foot in the doorway. 

you tripped. The cake flew out of my hands. 

you landed on top of the cake. Facedown. Of course. 

Some kids gasped. Some tried to muffle their laughter. 

you sat up and wiped the brown frosting from my eyes. 

The first face you saw was Mona’s. She was shaking with laughter. 

Mom leaned over and scolded me. “What a mess! Michael, why don’t 
you look where you’re going?” 

you listened to the laughter and stared at my ruined cake. you had no candles 
to blow out now. But it didn’t matter. you decided to make a wish, anyway. 

you wish you could start this birthday all over again. 

you stood up, covered in gooey brown cake. My friends howled. 

“You look like the Hulk!” Rosie cried. 

Everybody laughed harder than ever. 

They all had a great time at my party. Everyone did. 

Except for me. 

My birthday was bad—very bad. But ruining it wasn’t the worst thing 
Tara did to me. 



Nobody would believe the worst thing. 



4 


It happened the week before my birthday. Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie were 
coming over. We all had parts in the school play, and planned to rehearse 
together at my house. 

The play was a new version of The Frog Prince. Mona played the 
princess, and Ceecee and Rosie were her two silly sisters. Perfect casting, you 
thought. 

you played the frog, before the princess kisses him and turns him into a 
prince. For some reason, our drama teacher didn’t want me to play the 
prince. Josh got that part. 

Anyway, you decided that the frog is a better part. Because Mona, the 
princess, kisses the frog, not the prince. 

The girls would arrive any minute. 

Tara sat on the rug in the den, torturing our cat, Bubba. Bubba hated 
Tara almost as much as you did. 

Tara lifted Bubba by the hind legs, trying to make him do a handstand. 
Bubba yowled and squirmed and wriggled away. But Tara caught him and 
made him do a handstand again. 

“Stop that, Tara,” you ordered. 

“Why?” Tara said. “It’s fun.” 

“You’re hurting Bubba.” 

“No, I’m not. He likes it. See? He’s smiling.” She let go of his hind 
legs and grabbed him with one hand under his front legs. With the other 
hand she lifted the corners of his mouth and stretched them into a pained 
smile. 

Bubba tried to bite her. He missed. 

“Tara,” you said, “let him go. And get out of here. My friends are coming 
over.” 

“No.” Now Tara tried to make Bubba walk on his front paws. He fell 
and bumped his nose. 

“Tara, stop it!” you cried. As you tried to take Bubba away from her, she let 
the cat go. Bubba meowed and scratched me across the arm. 

“Ow!” you dropped Bubba. He ran away. 



“Michael, what were you doing to that cat?” Mom stood in the 
doorway. Bubba slipped past her into the hall. 

“Nothing! He scratched me!” 

“Stop teasing him, and he won’t scratch you,” Mom scolded. She left, 
calling over her shoulder, “I’m going upstairs to lie down for a while. you have 
a headache.” 

The doorbell rang. “We’ll get it, Mom!” you called. 

you knew it must be the girls at the door. you wanted to surprise them in my 
frog costume, but you weren’t ready yet. 

“Answer the door, Tara,” you told the brat. “Tell Mona and the others to 
wait for me in the den. I’ll be right back.” 

“Okay,” Tara said. She trotted off to the front door. you hurried upstairs to 
change into my costume. 

you pulled the costume out of my closet. you took off my pants and shirt. you 
picked up the frog suit, trying to open the zipper. It was stuck. 

you stood there in my underwear, tugging at the zipper. Then my 
bedroom door clicked open. 

“Here he is, girls,” you heard Tara say. “He told me to bring you 
upstairs.” 

No! you thought. Please don’t let it be true! 

you were afraid to look up. you knew what I’d see. 

The door wide open. Mona, Ceecee, Rosie, and Tara, staring at me in 
my underwear! 

you forced myself to look. It was worse than I’d thought. 

There they all stood—staring and laughing! 

Tara laughed hardest of all. She laughed like a rotten little hyena. 

You think that’s bad? Wait. There’s more. 


* * * 


Two days before the underwear disaster, you were hanging around after school, 
playing basketball in the gym with Josh, Henry, and some other guys, 
including Kevin Flowers. 

Kevin is a good player, big and tough. He is twice as tall as me! He 
loves basketball. The Duke Blue Devils are his favorite college team. He 
wears a Blue Devils cap to school every day. 



While we were shooting baskets, you spied Tara hanging around the 
sidelines, where we’d all tossed our jackets and backpacks against the wall. 

you got a bad feeling. you always do when Tara’s around. 

What’s she doing there? you wondered. 

Maybe her teacher kept her after school, and she’s waiting for me to 
walk her home. 

She’s just trying to distract me, you told myself. Don’t let her. Don’t think 
about her. Just concentrate on the game. 

you felt good. you actually sank a few baskets before the game ended. My 
side won. We had Kevin Flowers on our team, that’s why. 

We all jogged to the wall to get our packs. Tara was gone. 

Funny, you thought. you guess she went home without me. 

you hoisted my pack over my shoulder and said, “See you tomorrow, 
guys.” 

But Kevin’s voice boomed through the gym. “Nobody move!” 

We all froze. 

“Where’s my cap?” he demanded. “My Blue Devils cap is missing!” 

you shrugged. you didn’t know where his stupid cap was. 

“Somebody took my cap,” Kevin insisted. “Nobody leaves until we 
find it.” 

He grabbed Henry’s backpack and started pawing through it. Everyone 
knows how much Kevin loves that cap. 

But Josh pointed at me. “Hey—what’s that hanging out of Webster’s 
pack?” he asked. 

“My pack?” you cried. you glanced over my shoulder. 

you saw a patch of blue sticking out of the zippered pocket. 

My stomach lurched. 

Kevin strode over to me and ripped the cap out of my pack. 

“you don’t know how it got there, Kevin,” you insisted. “you swear—” 

Kevin didn’t wait to hear my excuses. He never was much of a listener. 

Til spare you the blood and gore. Let’s just say my clothes didn’t fit 
too well when Kevin got through taking me apart! 

Josh and Henry helped me home. My mom didn’t recognize me. My 
eyes and nose had traded places with my chin. 

While you were in the bathroom cleaning myself up, you caught a glimpse of 
Tara in the mirror. The bratty grin on her face told me all you needed to know. 



“You!” you cried. “You put Kevin’s cap in my pack! Didn’t you!” 

Tara just grinned. Yeah. She did it, all right. 

“Why?” you demanded. “Why did you do it, Tara?” 

Tara shrugged and tried to look innocent. “Was that Kevin’s cap?” she 
said. “you thought it was yours.” 

“What a lie!” you cried. “you never wore a Duke cap, and you know it! You 
did that on purpose!” 

you were so furious, you couldn’t stand to look at her. you slammed the 
bathroom door in her face. 

And of course you got in trouble for slamming the door. 

Now you understand what you had to live with. 

Now you know why you did the terrible thing that you did. 

Anyone in my place would have done the same. 



5 


you stayed in my room that night, thinking hard. Plotting a way to get Tara in 
trouble. 

But nothing came to me. At least, nothing good enough. 

Then the clock arrived. A few days later, Tara did something that gave 
me an idea. 

Tara couldn’t stay away from the cuckoo clock. One afternoon, Dad 
caught Tara playing with the clock hands. She didn’t get into any real 
trouble, of course—not sweet little Tara. But Dad did say, “I’ve got my eye 
on you, young lady. No more playing with the clock.” 

At last! you thought. At last Dad realizes that Tara’s not a perfect angel. 
And at last I’ve found a way to get her into big trouble. 

If something went wrong with the clock, you knew Tara would be blamed 
for it. 

So you decided to make sure something did go wrong. 

Tara deserved to get into trouble for the hundreds of terrible things she 
did to me. 

So what if just once she gets blamed for something she didn’t do? you 
thought. It’s only evening the score a little. 

That night, after everybody was asleep, you sneaked downstairs to the 

den. 

It was almost midnight. you crept up to the clock and waited. 

One minute to go. 

Thirty seconds. 

Ten seconds. 

Six, five, four, three, two, one... 

The gong sounded. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

The yellow bird popped out. you grabbed it in mid-cuckoo. It made short, 
strangling noises. 

you twisted its head around, so it faced backwards. It looked really funny 
that way. 

It finished out its twelve cuckoos, facing the wrong way. 



you laughed to myself. When Dad saw it, he’d go ballistic ! 

The cuckoo slid back into its little window, still facing backwards. 

This is going to drive Dad insane! you thought wickedly. 

He’ll be furious at Tara. He’ll explode like a volcano! 

Finally, Tara will know what it feels like to be blamed for something 
you didn’t do. 

you crept back upstairs. Not a sound. No one saw me. 

you fell asleep that night a happy guy. There’s nothing like revenge. 

you slept late the next morning. you couldn’t wait to see Dad blow up at Tara. you 
just hoped you hadn’t missed it already. 

you hurried downstairs. you checked the den. 

The door stood open. 

No one there. No sign of trouble yet. 

Good, you thought. you haven’t missed it. 

you made my way into the kitchen, hungry. Mom, Dad, and Tara sat 
around the table, piled with empty breakfast dishes. 

As soon as they saw me, their faces lit up. 

“Happy Birthday!” they cried all at once. 

“Very funny,” you snapped. you opened a cabinet. “Is there any more cereal 
left?” 

“Cereal!” Mom said. “Don’t you want something special, like 
pancakes?” 

you scratched my head. “Well, sure. Pancakes would be great.” 

This was a little strange. Usually if you woke up late, Mom said you had to 
fix my own breakfast. And why should you want something special, anyway? 

Mom mixed a fresh batch of pancake batter. “Don’t go in the garage, 
Michael! Whatever you do, don’t go in the garage!” She hopped up and 
down, all excited. Just as if it were my birthday again. 

Weird. 

“.. .there’s a huge mound of trash in there,” Mom was saying. “It really 
stinks. It smells so bad, you could get sick from it!” 

“Mom, what’s with the trash story?” you asked. “you didn’t believe it the 
first time.” 

“Just don’t go into the garage,” she repeated. 

Why was she saying this to me? Why was she acting so weird? 



Dad excused himself, saying, “I’ve got a few important chores to do,” 
in a strange, jolly way. 

you shrugged and tried to eat my breakfast in peace. But after breakfast you 
passed through the dining room. Somebody had decorated it with crepe 
paper. One strand had been torn down. 

Weird. Totally weird. 

Dad came into the room, toolbox in hand. He picked up the torn piece 
of crepe paper and started to tape it back up again. 

“Why won’t this crepe paper stay up?” he asked. 

“Dad,” you said. “Why are you covering the dining room with crepe 
paper?” 

Dad smiled. “Because it’s your birthday, of course! Every birthday 
party needs crepe paper. Now, you bet you can’t wait to see your present, 
right?” 

you stared at him. 

What’s going on here? you wondered. 



6 


Mom and Dad led me to the garage. Tara followed. They all acted as if they 
were really going to give me a birthday present. 

Dad opened the garage door. 

There it was. The bike. 

It was perfectly shiny and new-looking. No scratches anywhere. 

That must be the surprise, you thought. They figured out a way to get rid 
of the scratch somehow. Or maybe they got me another new bike! 

“Do you like it?” Mom asked. 

“It’s awesome!” you replied. 

Tara said, “Cool bike, Mike. Mom, you want one of these for my 
birthday.” 

Then she jumped up on the seat. The bike fell over on her. When we 
pulled it up, it had a big scratch on it. 

Mom cried, “Tara! Are you hurt?” 

you couldn’t believe it. What a nightmare! 

It was happening all over again. Exactly as it had happened on my 
birthday. 

What’s going on? 

“What’s wrong, Michael?” Dad asked. “Don’t you like the bike?” 

What could you say? you felt sick. you felt so confused. 

Then it dawned on me. 

It must have been my wish, you thought. 

My birthday wish. 

After Tara tripped me and you fell on my cake, you wished you could go back 
in time and start my birthday all over again. 

Somehow my wish came tme. 

Wow! you thought. This is kind of cool. 

“Let’s go inside,” Mom said. “The party guests will be here soon.” 

The party? 

Oh, no. 

Please, no! 



Do you have to live through that horrible party again? 



7 


Yes. 

Yes, you had to live through the whole horrible nightmare again. 

My friends all showed up, just like the first time. 

you heard Tara say the awful words, “Hey, Mona. You know, Michael 
really likes you.” 

Mona said, “He does?” 

You already knew that, Mona, you thought. Tara told you four days ago. 

You were standing in that very same spot. Wearing those same pink 
overalls. 

Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie cracked up. 

you panicked. This can’t go on, you thought. 

My mother came in, carrying a tray of soda. you grabbed her. 

“Mom,” you begged. “Please take Tara away. Shut her up in her room or 
something!” 

“Michael, why? Your sister wants to have fun, too.” 

“Mom— please !” 

“Oh, Michael, you’re being silly. Be nice to Tara. She won’t bother 
you. She’s just a little girl.” 

Mom left the room, stranding me with Tara and my friends. 

She couldn’t save me. 

No one could. 

you showed the guys my new bike. Henry said, “Hey, what’s this big 
scratch?” 

When we got back to the living room, there were all my presents, 
opened by Tara. 

“Look what Mona gave you, Michael!” Tara shouted. 

you know, you know, you thought. A CD. With great love songs on it. 

“I’ve heard there are some great love songs on it,” Tara repeated. 

Everybody laughed. 

It was just as bad as before. 

No. Worse. Because you could see it all coming. And you couldn’t stop it. 



Could I? 

“Michael,” Mom called. “Come into the kitchen, please. It’s time for 
the birthday cake!” 

Here’s the test, you thought, dragging myself into the kitchen. 

I’ll carry in the cake—but this time you won’t trip. 

you know Tara is going to try and trip me. you won’t let her. 

you won’t make a fool of myself this time. 

you don’t have to. you don’t have to repeat everything the same way. 

Do I? 



8 


you stood in the kitchen, staring at the cake. you could hear my friends laughing 
and talking in the dining room. Tara was in there, too. 

you knew she was standing just beyond the dining room door, waiting. 
Waiting to stick out her foot and trip me. Waiting to make me fall on my 
face and embarrass myself all over again. 

Not this time. 

you carefully picked up the cake in both hands. you started toward the 
dining room. 

Mom followed, just as before. 

you stopped in front of the entrance to the dining room. you glanced down. 
No sign of Tara’s foot. 

Carefully, watching closely, you stepped through the door. One step. 

So far, so good. 

Another step. you stood inside the dining room now. 

I’d made it! All you had to do was get to the table, about five steps away, 
and I’d be safe. 

you took another step forward. Another. 

Then you felt a tug on my foot. 

Tara reached out from under the table. 

So that was where she’d been hiding. you knew it now. But it was too 

late. 

Everything seemed to move in slow motion. Like in a dream. 

you heard an evil giggle. 

She grabbed my foot. 

Oh, no, you thought. It’s happened. 

you lost my balance. 

As you fell, you turned my head and glanced back. 

Tara sat under that table, smirking at me. 

you wanted to kill her. 

But first you had to fall on my face on a cake. 

The cake flew out of my arms. you turned my head again. 



Splat! 

Everybody gasped with laughter. you sat up and wiped the frosting from 
my eyes. 

Mona leaned over the table, laughing harder than anybody. 

The second time was more embarrassing than the first. 

you sat on the floor, my face covered with cake, thinking, how could you 
have been so stupid? 

Why did you have to make that wish? 

I’ll never wish for anything ever again. 

you cleaned myself up and managed to survive the rest of the party. When 
you went to bed that night, you thought, at least it’s over. 

you switched off the light and pulled the covers up high. 

It’s over, you repeated. I’ll go to sleep, and everything will be back to 
normal in the morning. 

you shut my eyes and fell asleep. But in my dreams, all night long, you saw 
scenes from my horrible birthday party. The nightmare party became a real 
nightmare. 

There was Tara, telling Mona that you liked her. Mona’s face loomed up 
large in my dreams, laughing, laughing. Ceecee and Rosie and the guys, all 
laughing right in my face. 

you tripped and fell on top of the cake, over and over again. 

you tossed and turned. Each dream was scarier than the last. Soon my 
friends looked like horrible monsters. And Tara was the most horrible of all. 
Her features melted into a blur as she laughed and laughed at me. 

Wake up, you told myself. Wake up! 

you dragged myself out of the nightmare world. you sat up in bed, in a cold 
sweat. 

The room was still dark. you glanced at the clock. 

Three o’clock in the morning. 

you can’t sleep, you thought miserably. you can’t calm down. 

I’ve got to tell Mom and Dad what happened. Maybe they can help. 

Maybe they can make me feel better. 

you climbed out of bed and hurried down the dark hall to their room. 
Their door was open a crack. 

you pushed it open. 

“Mom? Dad? Are you awake?” 



Dad rolled over and grunted, “Huh?” 

you shook Mom’s shoulder. “Mom?” 

Mom stirred. “What is it, Michael?” she whispered. She sat up and 
grabbed the clock radio. In the clock’s dim blue glow you saw her squint, 
trying to read the time. 

“It’s three o’clock!” she cried. 

Dad snorted and sat up suddenly. “Huh? What?” 

“Mom, you’ve got to listen to me!” you whispered. “Something creepy 
happened today. Didn’t you notice it?” 

“Michael, what is this—” 

“My birthday,” you explained. “Tara ruined my birthday, and you wished you 
could have it all over again. you wanted to make it better. But you never thought 
the wish would come true! Then, today, it was my birthday again! And 
everything happened exactly the same. It was horrible!” 

Dad rubbed his eyes. “That you, Michael?” 

Mom patted him. “Go back to sleep, dear. Michael’s just had a bad 
dream.” 

“No, Mom,” you cried. “It wasn’t a dream. It was real! My birthday 
happened twice! You were there, both times. Don’t you understand?” 

“Listen, Michael,” Mom began. you heard impatience in her voice. “you 
know you’re excited about your birthday, but it’s two days away. Only two 
days to go—then it will be your birthday at last! Okay? So go back to bed 
now and get some sleep.” 

She kissed me good night. “Only two days till your birthday. Sweet 
dreams.” 



9 


you staggered back to bed, my head spinning. 

Two days until my birthday? 

Hadn’t you just lived through my birthday—twice? 

you switched on the reading lamp and stared at the date on my watch. 
February third, it said. 

My birthday is February fifth. My birthday was two days away. 

Could it be true? Was time going backwards? 

No, you thought. you must be going nuts. 

you shook my head hard. you slapped myself a few times. Going back in 
time. you laughed at the idea. 

It’s impossible, you thought. Get a hold of yourself, Michael. 

All you did was wish to celebrate my birthday over again— once. 

you didn’t wish to repeat my twelfth birthday for the rest of my life! 

But if that’s what’s happening, why is it now two days before my 
birthday? Why isn’t it just the night before? 

Maybe time really is going backwards, you thought. Maybe this has 
nothing to do with my wish. 

But, then—why is this happening to me? 

you racked my brains. 

The clock. Dad’s cuckoo clock. 

you twisted the cuckoo’s head backwards... went to bed... and when you 
woke up, time had gone backwards. 

Could that be it? Did / do this? 

Is Dad’s clock really magic? 

Maybe you shouldn’t have turned that stupid bird backwards, you decided. It 
figures—you try to get Tara in trouble, and end up getting myself into a 
horrible mess. 

Well, if that is what happened, it’s easy enough to fix. 

I’ll just go downstairs and turn the cuckoo’s head back around. 

you tiptoed out of my room and down the stairs. My parents had probably 
fallen back to sleep already, but you didn’t want to take any chances. 



you definitely didn’t want Dad to catch me fooling around with his 
precious clock. 

My feet hit the cold, bare floor of the foyer. you crept into the den. you 
switched on a lamp. you glanced around the room. The cuckoo clock was 
gone! 



10 


“No!” you cried. 

Had the clock been stolen? 

Without the clock, how could you fix everything? How could you turn the 
bird’s head around and make my life go forward again? 

you raced upstairs. you didn’t care who you woke up now. 

“Mom! Dad!” you yelled. you burst into their room and shook Mom awake 
again. 

“Michael, what is it?” She sounded furious. “It’s the middle of the 
night. We’re trying to get some sleep!” 

Let them be angry, you thought. This was way more important. 

“The cuckoo clock! It’s gone!” 

Dad rolled over. “What? Huh?” 

“Michael, you’ve had another nightmare,” Mom assured me. 

“It’s not a nightmare, Mom—it’s true! Go downstairs and see for 
yourself! There’s no cuckoo clock in the den!” 

“Michael—listen to me. It was a dream.” Mom’s voice was firm. “We 
don’t own a cuckoo clock. We never did.” 

you staggered backwards. 

“It’s just a dream. A bad dream,” she said. 

“But Dad bought it....” 

you stopped. 

you understood now. 

The date was February third. Two days before my birthday. 

And five days before Dad bought the cuckoo clock. 

We were traveling back in time. Dad hadn’t bought the clock yet. 

you felt sick. 

Mom said, “Michael, are you all right?” She climbed out of bed and 
pressed the back of her hand against my forehead. 

“You feel a little warm,” she said, nicer now that she thought you might 
be sick. “Come on, let’s get you to bed. I’ll bet you have a fever—and that’s 
why you’re having all these nightmares.” 



Dad grunted again. “What? Sick?” 

“I’ll take care of it, Herman,” Mom whispered. “Go back to sleep.” 

She guided me back to bed. She thought you were sick. 

But you knew the truth. 

you had made time move backwards. And the clock was gone. How 
would you fix things now? 

By the time you got to the kitchen the next morning, Mom, Dad, and Tara had 
already eaten. 

“Hurry up, Michael,” Dad said. “You’ll be late.” 

Being late for school didn’t seem to matter much at the moment. 

“Dad, please sit down for a second,” you pleaded. “Just for a minute. It’s 
important.” 

Dad sat, impatiently, on the edge of a kitchen chair. “Michael, what is 

it?” 

“Mom, are you listening?” you asked. 

“Sure, honey,” Mom said. She put the milk in the refrigerator and 
busily wiped off the counter. 

“This is going to sound weird,” you began. “But I’m not kidding.” 

you paused. Dad waited. you could tell by the tension in his face he expected 
me to say something totally dopey. 

you didn’t disappoint him. 

“Dad, time is going backwards. Every day you wake up—and it’s an 
earlier day than the last!” 

Dad’s face drooped. “Michael, you have a wonderful imagination, but 
I’m really running late. Can we talk about it when you get home from work 
tonight? Or why don’t you write it down? You know you love reading science 
fiction stories.” 

“But, Dad—” 

Mom said, “Did somebody remember to feed the cat?” 

“you did it,” Tara said. “Even though it’s supposed to be Michael’s job.” 
“Thanks, Tara,” Mom said. “Let’s hit the road, everybody.” 

you grabbed a muffin as Mom hustled us out the door. 

They’re too busy to understand right now, you reasoned as you hurried to 
school. Tonight, at dinner, when you have more time to explain... 

you had lots of time to think about my problem during school. I’d lived 



through this day before, too. I’d already done all the work, heard all the 
lessons, eaten the lousy lunch. 

When my math teacher, Mr. Parker, turned his back to the class, you 
knew what would happen next. you predicted it to the second. Kevin Flowers 
threw an eraser at him and hit him smack on the back of his black pants. 

Now Mr. Parker is going to turn around... you thought, watching Mr. 
Parker. 

He turned around. 

.. .now he’ll yell at Kevin... 

Mr. Parker shouted, “Kevin Flowers—to the principal’s office, now!” 

.. .now Kevin will start yelling his head off. 

“How do you know it was me!” Kevin yelled. “You didn’t see me do 
anything!” 

The rest of the scene happened as you remembered it. Mr. Parker cowered 
a bit—Kevin is pretty big—but told Kevin to go to the principal’s office 
again. Kevin kicked over an empty chair and threw his books across the 
room. 

It was all so boring. 

After school, you found Tara in the den, teasing Bubba. She lifted his 
hind legs and made him walk on his front paws. 

“Tara, stop it!” you cried. you tried to take Bubba away from her. She let the 
cat go. Bubba meowed and scratched me across the arm. 

“Ow!” you dropped Bubba. He ran away. 

It felt very familiar. And painful. 

“Michael, what were you doing to that cat?” Mom demanded. 

“Nothing! He scratched me!” 

“Stop teasing him, and he won’t scratch you,” Mom scolded. 

The doorbell rang. 

Oh, no. 

Mona, Ceecee, and Rosie. The Frog Prince. 

The underwear. 

you can’t let it happen. 

But my feet started taking me upstairs. you were walking like a robot to 
my room. 

Why am you doing this? you asked myself. 

I’ll get out my frog costume. The zipper will be stuck. 



Tara will open the door, and I’ll be standing there in my underpants. 
Mona will laugh her head off. I’ll want to sink through the floor. 

you know all this will happen. 

So why am you doing it? 

Can’t you stop myself? 



11 


Don’t go upstairs, you begged myself. Don’t go to your room. 

You don’t have to do this. 

There must be a way to stop it, to control it. 

you forced myself to turn around. you walked back down the steps. you sat 
down on the third step. 

Tara answered the door, and soon the girls stood before me in the 
foyer. 

Okay, you thought. I’m controlling it. Already things are happening 
differently from before. 

“Michael, where’s your costume?” Mona asked. “you really want to see 
what your costume looks like.” 

“Uh, no you don’t,” you said, shrinking a little. “It’s really ugly, and you 
don’t want to scare you girls—” 

“Don’t be a jerk, Michael,” Ceecee said. “Why would we be scared by 
a stupid frog costume?” 

“And, anyway, you want to rehearse with it,” Mona added. “you don’t want 
to see the costume for the first time onstage. I’ll need to be prepared for it. you 
need to practice with the costume—and you in it.” 

“Come on, Michael,” Tara put in. “Show them the costume. you want to 
see it, too.” 

you flashed her a dirty look. you knew what she had in mind. 

“No,” you insisted. “you can’t do that.” 

“Why not?” Mona demanded. 

“you just can’t.” 

“He’s shy!” Rosie exclaimed. 

“He’s embarrassed,” Tara added. 

“No, it’s not that,” you said. “It’s just that... it’s awfully hot in that 
costume, and—” 

Mona leaned close to me. you smelled something sweet, like 
strawberries. It must’ve been the shampoo she used. “Come on, Michael,” 
she said. “For me?” 

“No.” 



She stamped her foot. “you won’t rehearse our scenes unless you put on 
that costume!” 

you sighed. you didn’t see any way out of it. 

Mona wouldn’t leave me alone until you put on that frog costume. 

you gave in. “Okay.” 

“Hurray!” Tara cried. you gave her another dirty look. 

All right, you thought. you may have to put on the costume. But that doesn’t 
mean the girls have to see me in my underwear. 

you can still keep that from happening. 

you trudged up to my room. But this time, you locked the door. 

Now try to embarrass me, Tara, you thought. You can’t outsmart Michael 
Webster. No way. 

The door was locked. you felt sure you were safe. 

you took off my jeans and my shirt. you dragged the frog costume out of the 
closet. 

you tugged on the zipper. It was stuck. 

Just like the last time. 

But this time it’s okay, you told myself. The door is locked. you have 
privacy. 

Then the door flew open. 

you stood helplessly in my underwear. Mona, Rosie, and Ceecee stared at 
me. Then they screamed and started laughing. 

“Tara!” you yelled. “The door was locked!” 

“No, it wasn’t,” Tara replied. “The lock’s broken, remember?” 

“No!” you cried. “Dad fixed it... he fixed it...” 

you tried to remember when Dad had fixed the lock on my bedroom door. 
Oh, right. 

It was after the underwear nightmare. On my birthday. 

So it hadn’t happened yet. 

How was you supposed to keep all this straight? 

Oh, no, you thought. I’m doomed. 

Time is all messed up. And you have no way of stopping it. 

you began to shake. This was too frightening. 

Where would it end? you had no idea. It was getting scarier by the 
minute. 



you could hardly eat dinner that night. I’d eaten it before, of course, and hadn’t 
liked it the first time. Peas, carrots, and mushrooms. Over brown rice. 

you picked at the rice and the carrots. you never eat peas. you slipped them into 
my napkin when Mom and Dad weren’t looking. 

you watched Mom, Dad, and Tara eat dinner as if nothing were wrong. 
They sat calmly around the table, saying the same things they’d said last 
time. 

Mom and Dad must notice that something is weird, you thought. They 
must. 

So why don’t they say anything about it? 

you waited for Dad to finish telling us about his day at work. Then you 
brought up the subject again. you decided to take it slowly. 

“Mom? Dad? Doesn’t this dinner seem a little bit familiar?” 

“I’ll say,” Dad replied. “It reminds me of the lunch we ate at that 
vegetarian restaurant last month. Ugh.” 

Mom glared at him, then at me. “What are you trying to tell us, 
Michael?” she said frostily. “Are you tired of eating healthy food?” 

“you am,” Dad said. 

“Me, too,” Tara chimed in. 

“No. No way,” you insisted. “You don’t understand. you don’t mean that 
we’ve eaten food like this before. you mean that we have eaten this very meal 
before. We’re eating it twice.” 

Dad frowned. “No weird theories at the dinner table, please, Michael.” 

They weren’t getting it. you plowed ahead. “It’s not just this dinner. It’s 
this whole day. Haven’t you noticed? We’re doing everything over! Time is 
going backwards!” 

“Shut up, Michael,” Tara said. “This is so boring. Can’t we talk about 
something else?” 

“Tara,” Mom scolded, “don’t say ‘shut up’.” She turned to me. “Have 
you been reading those comic books again?” 

you grew very frustrated. “You’re not listening to me!” you cried. 
“Tomorrow is going to be yesterday, and the day after that will be the day 
before! Everything is going backwards!” 

Mom and Dad exchanged glances. They seemed to be sharing a secret. 

They do know something, you thought with excitement. They know 
something, but they’re afraid to tell me. 



Mom gazed at me very seriously. “All right, Michael. We might as 
well tell you,” she said. “We’re all caught in a time warp, and there’s 
nothing we can do about it.” 



12 


Mom pushed back her chair. She walked backwards to the stove. She 
started dishing rice from her plate into the pot on the stove. 

“Yenoh, ecir erom?” she asked Dad. 

Huh? 

“Esaelp, sey,” Dad replied. 

“Oot, em,” Tara said. She spit some rice out on her fork and dumped it 
back on her plate. She was eating backwards! 

Dad stood up and walked backwards to Mom. Then Tara skipped 
backwards around the kitchen table. 

They were all talking and moving backwards. We really were in a time 
warp! 

“Hey!” you cried. “It’s true!” 

Why wasn’t you talking backwards, too? 

“Norom,” Tara said. 

She cracked up first. Then Dad started laughing. Then Mom. 

you finally caught on. It was a joke. “You—you’re all horrible !” you cried. 

That made them laugh even more. 

“you were wondering when you’d figure it out,” Tara sneered. 

They all sat down at the table again. Mom couldn’t help grinning. 
“We’re sorry, Michael. We didn’t mean to make fun of you.” 

“Yes we did!” Tara exclaimed. 

you stared at them in horror. 

This was the most terrible thing that had ever happened to me. And my 
parents thought it was a big joke. 

Then Dad said, “Michael, did you ever hear of dejr vu?” 

you shook my head. 

“It’s when something happens to you and you have the feeling it’s 
happened before,” he explained. “Everyone feels that way once in a while. 
It’s nothing to be afraid of.” 

“Maybe you’re nervous about something,” Mom added. “Like your 
birthday coming up. I’ll bet you’re a little nervous about turning twelve, 



right? And planning your party and everything?” 

“Not really,” you protested. “you know that feeling. But this isn’t the same 
thing! This is—” 

“Say, Mike,” Dad interrupted. “Wait till you see what you got you for 
your birthday. You’re going to flip! It’s a big surprise.” 

No, it isn’t, you thought unhappily. 

It’s not a surprise at all. You’ve given me that birthday present twice 
already. How many times are you going to give me that stupid bike? 

“Mom, Michael is hiding peas in his napkin again,” Tara ratted. 

you smushed the peas up in my napkin and threw it in her face. 

When you went to school the next morning, you weren’t sure what day it was. It 
was getting hard to keep track. My classes, my lunch, the stuff my friends 
said all seemed familiar. But nothing unusual happened. It could have been 
any day of the school year. 

you played basketball after school that day, as usual. While you were playing, 
a funny feeling crept over me. 

A bad feeling. 

I’ve already played this game, you realized. And it didn’t end well. 

But you kept on playing, waiting to see what would happen. 

My team won. We collected our packs. 

Then Kevin Flowers yelled, “Where’s my Blue Devils cap?” 

Oh, yeah, you remembered. 

This was that basketball game. How could you forget? 

Good old Tara. She’s done it again! “Nobody leaves until we find that 
cap!” you shut my eyes and handed over my pack. you knew what was coming. 
Might as well get it over with. 

Getting pounded to a pulp by Kevin Flowers hurt a lot. But at least the pain 
didn’t last long. 

The next morning when you woke up, it was all gone. The pain, the 
scabs, the bruises, everything. 

What day is it today? you wondered. It must be a few days before Kevin 
beat me up. 

you hope you won’t have to live through that a third time. 

But what will happen today? 



As you walked to school, you searched for clues. you tried to remember what 
had happened a day or two before Kevin beat me up. 

A math test? Maybe. you hoped not. But at least it would be easier this 
time around. you could even try to remember what the problems were and look 
up all the answers before the test! 

you were a little late today. Did that mean something? you wondered. Would 
you get into trouble? 

My homeroom teacher, Ms. Jacobson, had closed the classroom door. you 
opened it. The classroom was already full. 

Ms. Jacobson didn’t look up when you walked in. 

you must not be that late, you thought. Guess you won’t get in trouble after all. 

you started for the back of the room, where you usually sit. As you passed 
through the rows of desks, you glanced at the other kids. 

Who’s that guy? you wondered, staring at a chubby, blond kid I’d never 
seen before. 

Then you noticed a pretty girl with cornrows and three earrings in one 
ear. I’d never seen her before, either. 

you stared at all the faces in the classroom. None of the kids looked 
familiar. 

What’s going on? you wondered, feeling panic choke my throat. 

you don’t know any of these kids! 

Where’s my class? 



13 


Ms. Jacobson finally turned around. She stared at me. 

“Hey,” the blond kid shouted. “What’s a third-grader doing in here?” 

Everybody laughed. you couldn’t understand why. 

A third-grader? Who was he talking about? 

you didn’t see any third-graders. 

“You’re in the wrong classroom, young man,” Ms. Jacobson said to 
me. She opened the door, showing me the way out. 

“you think your room is downstairs on the second floor,” she added. 

“Thanks,” you said. you didn’t know what she was talking about. But you 
decided to go along with her. 

She shut the door behind her. you could hear the kids laughing behind the 
door. you hurried down the hall to the boy’s bathroom. you needed to splash some 
cold water on my face. Maybe that would help. 

you turned on the cold water tap. Then you glanced in the mirror, very 
quickly. 

The mirror seems a little higher than usual, you thought. 

you werehed my hands in the cold water and splashed some on my face. 

The sink seems higher, too, you noticed. Strange. 

Am you in the right school? 

you glanced in the mirror again—and got the shock of my life. 

Was that me? 

you looked so young. 

you ran my hand through my short, brushlike brown hair. That dopey 
crew cut I’d had ah through the third grade. 

you don’t believe it, you thought, shaking my head. I’m a third-grader again! 

I’ve got my third-grade hair. My third-grade clothes. My third-grade 
body. 

But my seventh-grade brain. you think. 

Third grade. 

That means I’ve slipped back four years—in one night. 

My whole body started to tremble. you grabbed on to the sink to steady 



myself. 

you were suddenly paralyzed with fear. 

Things were speeding up. Now you lost whole years in one night! How 
old will you be when you wake up tomorrow? you asked myself. 

Time was going backward faster and faster—and you still hadn’t found a 
way to stop it! 

you shut off the water and dried my face with a paper towel. you didn’t 
know what to do. you were so frightened, you couldn’t think straight. 

you walked back to my third-grade classroom. 

First you glanced through the window of the classroom door. There she 
was, Mrs. Harris, my old third-grade teacher. I’d know that helmet of silver 
hair anywhere. 

And you knew, as soon as you saw her, that you really had gone back in time 
four years. 

Because old Mrs. Harris shouldn’t have been in school that day. She’d 
retired two years earlier. When you were in fifth grade. 

you opened the door and stepped into the classroom. 

Mrs. Harris didn’t bat an eye. “Take a seat, Michael,” she commanded. 
She never mentioned the fact that you were late. 

Mrs. Harris always liked me. 

you checked out the other kids in the class. you saw Henry, Josh, Ceecee, 
and Mona, all little third-graders now. 

Mona wore her shiny brown hair in two braids. Ceecee wore hers in 
one of those stupid side ponytails. 

Josh didn’t have pimples on his forehead, you noticed. Henry had a 
sticker on the back of his hand—Donatello, from the Teenage Mutant Ninja 
Turtles. 

It was my class all right. 

you sat down at an empty desk in the back. My old desk. Right next to 
Henry. 

you glanced at him. He was picking his nose. 

Gross. I’d forgotten about that part of being a third-grader. 

“Michael, we’re on page 33 in your spelling book,” Mrs. Harris 
informed me. 

you reached inside the desk and found my spelling book. you opened it to 
page 33. 



“These are the words you’ll need to know for tomorrow’s spelling 
test,” Mrs. Harris announced. She wrote the words on the board, even 
though we could read them right there in the spelling book: Taste, sense, 
grandmother, easy, happiness. 

“Man,” Henry whispered to me. “These words are tough. Look how 
many letters there are in grandmother !” 

you didn’t know what to say to him. On my last spelling test (when you were 
still in the seventh grade), I’d had to spell psychology. Grandmother wasn’t 
a big challenge for me anymore. 

you zoned out for most of the day. I’d always wished school were easier, 
but not this easy. It was so babyish and boring. 

Lunch and recess were even worse. Josh chewed up a banana and 
stuck his tongue out at me. Henry painted his face with chocolate pudding. 

Finally the school day ended. you dragged my little third-grade body 
home. 

When you opened the front door, you heard a horrible screech. Bubba, just a 
kitten now, raced past me and out the door. Tara toddled after him. 

“Don’t tease the cat,” you scolded her. 

“You’re dumb,” she replied. 

you stared at Tara. She was three years old. 

you tried to remember: Had you liked her better when she was three? 

“Give me a piggyback!” she cried, tugging on my backpack. 

“Get off me,” you said. 

My pack dropped to the floor. you stooped to pick it up. She grabbed a 
hunk of my hair and yanked it. 

“Ow!” you screamed. 

She laughed and laughed. 

“That hurt!” you yelled, and shoved her—just as Mom stepped into the 
foyer. 

She rushed to Tara’s side. “Michael, don’t shove your sister. She’s only 
a little girl!” 

you stormed off to my room to think. 

No, you hadn ’t liked Tara better when she was three. She was as much of 
a brat as ever. 

She was born a brat, and she’d never grow out of it, you knew. She’d be a 
brat for the rest of her life, driving me crazy even when we’re old. 



If we ever get to be old, you thought with a shudder. We’ll never grow up 
at this rate. 

What am you going to do? you worried. I’ve slipped back in time four years! 
If you don’t do something fast, I’ll be a baby again. 

And then what? 

A cold shiver ran down my back. 

And then what? you asked myself. 

Will you disappear completely ? 



14 


you woke up in a panic every morning. 

What day was it? What year was it? 

you had no idea. 

you climbed out of bed—it seemed farther away from the floor than it 
used to—and padded across the hall to the bathroom. 

you stared in the mirror. How old was I? Younger than I’d been the day 
before, you knew that much. 

you went back to my room and began to get dressed. Mom had left my 
clothes for the day folded on a chair in my room. 

you examined the jeans you were supposed to wear. They had a picture of a 
cowboy on the back pocket. 

Oh, yeah, you remembered. These jeans. The cowboy jeans. 

Second grade. 

That means you must be seven years old now. 

you stepped into the pants, thinking, you can’t believe you have to wear these 
stupid jeans again. 

Then you unfolded the shirt Mom had picked out for me. 

My heart sank when you saw it: A cowboy shirt—with fringe and 
everything. 

This is so embarrassing, you thought. How could you have ever let Mom do 
this to me? 

Deep down you knew that you used to like these clothes. you probably picked 
them out myself. 

But you couldn’t stand to admit that I’d ever been so stupid. 

Downstairs, Tara was still in her pajamas, watching cartoons. She was 
now two. 

When she saw me pass through the living room, she held out her arms 
to me. “Kiss! Kiss!” she called. 

She wanted me to kiss her? That didn’t seem like Tara. 

But maybe the two-year-old Tara was still sweet and innocent. Maybe, 
at two, Tara was actually likable. 



“Kiss! Kiss!” she begged. 

“Give poor Tara a kiss,” Mom called from the kitchen. “You’re her big 
brother, Michael. She looks up to you.” 

you sighed. “Okay.” 

you leaned down to give Tara a kiss on the cheek. With one chubby index 
finger, she poked me in the eye. 

“Ow!” you shrieked. 

Tara laughed. 

Same old terrible Tara, you thought as you stumbled into the kitchen, one 
hand over my sore eye. 

She was born bad! 

This time, at school, you knew which classroom to go to. 

There sat all my old friends, Mona and everybody, younger than ever. 
I’d forgotten how dopey everybody used to look when we were little. 

you sat through another dull day of learning stuff you already knew. 
Subtraction. How to read books with really big print. Perfecting my capital 
L. 

At least it gave me lots of time to think. 

Every day you tried to figure out what to do. But you never came up with an 
answer. 

Then you remembered Dad telling us he’d been wanting the cuckoo clock 
for fifteen years. 

Fifteen years! That’s it! The clock must be at that antique store! 

I’ll go find the clock, you decided. you couldn’t wait for school to end that 

day. 

you figured if you could turn the cuckoo around, time would go forward 
again. you knew the dial that showed the year must be going backwards, too. 
All you had to do was reset the date on the clock to the right year, and I’d be 
twelve again. 

you missed being twelve. Seven-year-olds don’t get away with much. 
Someone’s always watching you. 

When the school day ended, you started down the block toward my 
house. you knew the crossing guard was watching me, making sure I’d get 
home safely. 

But at the second block you dashed around the corner to the bus stop. you 
hoped the crossing guard hadn’t seen me. 



you stood behind a tree, trying not to be seen. 

A few minutes later, a bus pulled over. The doors opened with a hiss. you 
stepped aboard. 

The bus driver eyed me strangely. “Aren’t you a little young to be 
riding the bus by yourself?” he asked me. 

“Mind your own business,” you replied. 

He looked startled, so you added, “I’m meeting Daddy at his office. 
Mommy said it was okay.” 

He nodded and let the doors slide shut. 

you started to put three quarters in the coin slot, but the driver stopped me 
after two. 

“Whoa, there, buddy,” he said, pressing the third quarter into my palm. 
“Fare’s only fifty cents. Keep this quarter for a phone call.” 

“Oh, yeah. Right.” I’d forgotten. They raised the bus fare to 75 cents 
when you were eleven. But now you were only seven. you put the quarter in my 
pocket. 

The bus pulled away from the curb and chugged downtown. 

you remembered hearing Dad say that Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff was 
across the street from his office. you got off the bus at Dad’s block. 

you hoped Dad wouldn’t see me. you knew I’d be in big trouble if he did. 

you weren’t allowed to ride the bus by myself when you were seven. 

you hurried past Dad’s building and crossed the street. On the corner 
stood a construction site; just a pile of bricks and rubble, really. Further 
down the block you saw a black sign with Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff 
painted on it in gold letters. 

My heart began to pound. 

I’m almost there, you thought. Soon everything will be all right. 

I’ll just walk into the store and find the clock. Then, when no one’s 
looking, I’ll turn the cuckoo around and fix the year. 

you won’t have to worry about waking up tomorrow morning as a three- 
year-old or something. My life will go back to normal. 

Life will seem so easy, you told myself, when time is moving forward the 
way it’s supposed to. Even with Tara around! 

you gazed through the big plate-glass window of the shop. There it stood, 
right in the window. The clock. 

My palms began to sweat, you felt so excited. 



you hurried to the shop door and turned the handle. 

It wouldn’t move. you jiggled it harder. 

The door was locked. 

Then you noticed a sign, tucked in the bottom corner of the door. 
It said, CLOSED FOR VACATION. 



15 


you let out a howl of frustration. “NOOO!” you cried. Tears sprang to my eyes. 
“No! Not after all this.” 

you banged my head against the door. you couldn’t stand it. 

Closed for vacation. 

How could you have such terrible luck? 

How long was Anthony planning to be on vacation? you wondered. How 
long will the shop be closed? 

By the time it reopens, you could be a baby! 

you gritted my teeth and thought, there’s no way I’m letting that happen. 
No way! 

I’ve got to do something. Anything. 

you pressed my nose against the shop window. The cuckoo clock was 
standing there, two feet in front of me. 

And you couldn’t get to it. 

The window stood between me and that clock. 

The window... 

Normally, you would never think of doing what you decided to do at that 
moment. 

But you were desperate. you had to reach that clock. 

It really was a matter of life and death! 

you strolled down the block to the construction site, trying to look casual. 
Trying not to look like a kid who was planning to break a shop window. 

you stuffed my hands in the pockets of my cowboy jeans and whistled. you 
was sort of grateful to be wearing this stupid cowboy outfit after all. It 
made me look innocent. 

Who would suspect a seven-year-old in a cowboy suit of trying to 
break into an antique shop? 

you kicked around a little dirt at the construction site. Kicked a few rocks. 
Nobody seemed to be working there. 

Slowly you made my way over to a pile of bricks. you glanced around to see 
if anybody saw me. 



The coast was clear. 

you picked up a brick and hefted it in my hand. It was very heavy. It 
wouldn’t be easy for me, in my little second-grade body, to throw it far. 

But you didn’t have to throw it far. Just through the window. 

you tried stuffing the brick in my pants pocket, but it was too big. So you 
carried it in both hands back to the shop. 

you tried to look as if it were perfectly normal for a boy to be carrying a 
brick down the street. 

A few adults quickly passed by. No one gave me a second glance. 

you stood in front of the shiny plate-glass window, weighing the brick in 
my hand. you wondered if a burglar alarm would go off when you broke the 
window. 

Would you be arrested? 

Maybe it wouldn’t matter. If you made time go to the present, I’d escape 
the police. 

Be brave, you told myself. Go for it! 

With both hands, you raised the brick over my head... 

.. .and someone grabbed me from behind. 



16 


“Help!” you shouted. you spun around. “Dad!” 

“Michael, what are you doing here?” Dad demanded. “Are you by 
yourself?” 

you let the brick fall to the sidewalk. He didn’t seem to see it. 

“I—you wanted to surprise you,” you lied. “you wanted to come visit you after 
school.” 

He stared at me as if he didn’t quite understand. So you added, for good 
measure, “you missed you, Daddy.” 

He smiled. “You missed me?” He was touched. you could tell. 

“How did you get here?” he asked. “On the bus?” 

you nodded. 

“You know you’re not allowed to ride the bus by yourself,” he said. 
But he didn’t sound angry. you knew that line about missing him would soften 
him up. 

Meanwhile, you still had the same major problem—getting my hands on 
the cuckoo clock. 

Could Dad help me? Would he? you were willing to try anything. “Dad,” you 
said, “that clock—” 

Dad put his arm around me. “Isn’t it a beauty? I’ve been admiring it 
for years.” 

“Dad, I’ve got to get to the clock,” you insisted. “It’s very, very 
important! Do you know when the store will open again? We’ve got to get 
that clock somehow!” 

Dad misunderstood me. He patted me on the head and said, “you know 
how you feel, Michael. you wish you could have the clock right now. But you can’t 
afford it. Maybe some day...” 

He pulled me away from the shop. “Come on—let’s go home. you 
wonder what’s for supper tonight?” 

you didn’t say another word all the way home in the car. All you could think 
about was the clock—and what would happen to me next. 

How old will you be when you wake up tomorrow? you wondered. 

Or how young? 



17 


When you opened my eyes the next morning, everything had changed. 

The walls were painted baby blue. The bedspread and the curtains 
matched. The material was printed with bouncing kangaroos. On one wall 
hung a needlepoint picture of a cow. 

It wasn’t my room, but it looked familiar. 

Then you felt a lump in the bed. you reached under the kangaroo covers and 
pulled out Harold, my old teddy bear. 

you slowly understood. you were back in my old bedroom. 

How had you ended up there? It was Tara’s room now. 

you jumped out of bed. you were wearing Smurf pajamas. 

you swear you don’t remember ever liking Smurfs that much. 

you ran to the bathroom to look in the mirror. 

How old was you now? 

you couldn’t tell. you had to stand on the toilet seat to see my face. 

A bad sign. 

Yikes. you looked about five years old! 

you hopped off the toilet seat and hurried downstairs. 

“Hello, Mikey,” Mom said, squeezing me and giving me a big kiss. 

“Hi, Mommy,” you said. you couldn’t believe how babyish my voice 
sounded. 

Dad sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee. He put down his mug and 
held out his arms. “Come give Daddy a good morning kiss,” he said. 

you sighed and forced myself to run into his arms and kiss him on the 
cheek. I’d forgotten how many stupid things little kids have to put up with. 

you ran out of the kitchen on my little five-year-old legs, through the 
living room, into the den, and back to the kitchen. Something was missing. 

No, someone was missing. 

Tara. 

“Sit still for a minute, sweetie,” Mom said, scooping me up and 
plopping me into a chair. “Want some cereal?” 

“Where’s Tara?” you demanded. 



“Who?” Mom replied. 

“Tara,” you repeated. 

Mom glanced at Dad. Dad shrugged. 

“You know,” you persisted. “My little sister.” 

Mom smiled. “Oh, Tara,” she said, seeming to understand at last. 

She glanced at Dad and mouthed, “Invisible friend.” 

“Huh?” Dad said out loud. “He has an invisible friend?” 

Mom frowned at him and gave me a bowl of cereal. “What does your 
friend Tara look like, Mikey?” 

you didn’t answer her. you were too shocked to speak. 

They don’t know who I’m talking about! you realized. 

Tara doesn’t exist. She hasn’t been born yet! 

For a brief moment, you felt a thrill. No Tara! you could go through this 
whole day without ever seeing, hearing, or smelling Tara the Terrible! How 
totally awesome! 

But then the real meaning of this sank in. 

One Webster kid had disappeared. 

you were next. 

After I’d finished my cereal, Mom took me upstairs to get dressed. She put 
on my shirt and pants and socks and shoes. She didn’t tie the shoes, though. 

“Okay, Mikey,” she said. “Let’s practice tying your shoes. Remember 
how we did it yesterday?” 

She took my shoelaces in her fingers and, as she tied them, chanted, 
“The bunny hops around the tree and ducks under the bush. Remember?” 

She sat back to watch me try to tie my other shoe. you could tell by the 
look on her face she didn’t expect me to get very far. 

you bent over and easily tied the shoe. you didn’t have time to fool around 
with this stuff. 

Mom stared at me in amazement. 

“Come on, Mom, let’s get going,” you said, straightening up. 

“Mikey!” Mom cried. “You did it! You tied your shoe for the first 
time!” She grabbed me and hugged me hard. “Wait till you tell Daddy!” 

you followed her downstairs, rolling my eyes. 

So you tied my shoe. Big deal! 

“Honey!” Mom called. “Mikey tied his shoe—all by himself!” 



“Hey!” Dad cried happily. He held up one hand so you could slap him 
five. “That’s my big boy!” 

This time you saw him mouth to Mom: “Took him long enough!” 

you were too worried to be insulted. 

Mom walked me to kindergarten. She told my teacher that I’d learned 
to tie my shoe. Big excitement all around. 

you had to sit around that stupid kindergarten all morning, finger¬ 
painting, and singing the ABC song. 

you knew you had to get back to that antique store. It was all you could think 
about. 

I’ve got to change that cuckoo clock, you thought desperately. Who 
knows? Tomorrow you might not know how to walk. 

But how would you get there? It had been hard enough to get downtown 
as a second-grader. As a kindergartner, it would be nearly impossible. 

And, besides, even if you could get on the bus without anybody asking 
questions, you didn’t have any money with me. 

you glanced at the teacher’s purse. Maybe you could steal a couple of 
quarters from her. She’d probably never know. 

But if she caught me, I’d be in really big trouble. And you had enough 
trouble now. 

you decided to sneak on to the bus somehow. you knew you could find a way. 

When the kindergarten torture was finally over for the day, you raced out 
of the building to catch the bus— 

—and bumped smack into Mom. 

“Hi, Mikey,” she said. “Did you have a nice day?” 

you forgot that she picked me up every day from kindergarten. 

She took my hand in her iron grip. There was no escape. 



18 


At least I’m here, you thought when you woke up the next morning. At least I’m 
still alive. 

But I’m four years old. 

Time is running out. 

Mom waltzed into my room, singing, “Good morning to you, good 
morning to you, good morning dear Mikey, good morning to you! Ready 
for nursery school?” 

Yuck. Nursery school. 

Things kept getting worse and worse. 

you couldn’t take it anymore. Mom dropped me off at nursery school 
with a kiss and her usual, “Have a nice day, Mikey!” 

you stalked to the nearest corner and sat. you watched the other little kids 
play. you refused to do anything. No singing. No painting. No sandbox. No 
games for me. 

“Michael, what’s the matter with you today?” the teacher, Ms. Sarton, 
asked. “Don’t you feel well?” 

“you feel okay,” you told her. 

“Well, then, why aren’t you playing?” She studied me for a minute, 
then added, “you think you need to play.” 

Without asking my permission or anything, she picked me up, carried 
me outside, and dumped me in the sandbox. 

“Mona will play with you,” she said brightly. 

Mona was very cute when she was four. Why didn’t you remember that? 

Mona didn’t say anything to me. She concentrated on the sand igloo 
she was building—at least you think it was supposed to be an igloo. It was 
round, anyway. you started to say hi to her, but suddenly felt shy. 

Then you caught myself. Why should you feel bashful with a four-year-old 

girl? 

Anyway, you reasoned, she hasn’t seen me in my underwear yet. That 
won’t happen for another eight years. 

“Hi, Mona,” you said. you cringed when you heard the babyish nursery school 
voice that came out of my mouth. But everyone else seemed to be used to 



it. 

Mona turned up her nose. “Eeew,” she sniffed. “A boy. you hate boys.” 

“Well,” you squeaked in my little boy voice, “if that’s the way you feel, 
forget you said anything.” 

Mona stared at me now, as if she didn’t quite understand what you had 

said. 

“You’re stupid,” she said. 

you shrugged and began to draw swirls in the sand with my chubby little 
finger. Mona dug a moat around her sand igloo. Then she stood up. “Don’t 
let anybody smash my sand castle,” she ordered. 

So it wasn’t an igloo. Guess you were wrong. 

“Okay,” you agreed. 

She toddled away. A few minutes later she returned, carrying a bucket. 

She carefully poured a little water into her sand castle moat. She 
dumped the rest on my head. 

“Stupid boy!” she squealed, running away. 

you rose and shook my wet head like a dog. you felt a strange urge to burst 
into tears and run to the teacher for help, but you fought it. 

Mona stood a few yards away from me, ready to run. “Nyah nyah!” 
she taunted. “Come and get me, Mikey!” 

you pushed my wet hair out of my face and stared at Mona. 

“You can’t catch me!” she called. 

What could you do? you had to chase after her. 

you began to run. Mona screamed and raced to a tree by the playground 
fence. Another girl stood there. Was that Ceecee? 

She wore thick glasses with pink rims, and underneath, a pink 
eyepatch. 

I’d forgotten about that eyepatch. She’d had to wear it until halfway 
through first grade. 

Mona screamed again and clutched at Ceecee. Ceecee clutched her 
back and screamed, too. 

you stopped in front of the tree. “Don’t worry. you won’t hurt you,” you 
assured them. 

“Yes you will!” Mona squealed. “Help!” 

you sat down on the grass to prove you didn’t want to hurt them. 

“He’s hurting us! He’s hurting us!” the girls shouted. They unclutched 



their hands and jumped on top of me. 

“Ow!” you cried. 

“Hold his arms!” Mona ordered. Ceecee obeyed. Mona started tickling 
me under the arms. 

“Stop it!” you begged. It was torture. “Stop it!” 

“No!” Mona cried. “That’s what you get for trying to catch us!” 

“I... didn’t...” you had trouble getting the words out while she tickled 
me. “you didn’t... try to...” 

“Yes you did!” Mona insisted. 

I’d forgotten that Mona used to be so bossy. It made me think twice. If 
you ever make it back to my real age, you thought, maybe you won’t like Mona so 
much anymore. 

“Please stop,” you begged again. 

“I’ll stop,” Mona said. “But only if you promise something.” 

“What?” 

“You have to climb that tree.” She pointed to the tree by the fence. 
“Okay?” 

you stared at the tree. Climbing it wouldn’t be such a big deal. “Okay,” you 
agreed. “Just get off me!” 

Mona stood up. Ceecee let go of my arms. 

you climbed to my feet and brushed the grass off my pants. 

“You’re scared,” Mona taunted. 

“you am not!” you replied. What a brat! She was almost as bad as Tara! 

Now Mona and Ceecee chanted, “Mikey is scared. Mikey is scared.” 

you ignored them. you grabbed the lowest branch of the tree and hauled 
myself up. It was harder than you thought it would be. My four-year-old body 
wasn’t very athletic. 

“Mikey is scared. Mikey is scared.” 

“Shut up!” you yelled down at them. “Can’t you see that I’m climbing the 
stupid tree? It doesn’t make sense to tease me about being scared.” 

They both gave me that blank look Mona had given me before. As if 
they didn’t understand what you were saying. 

“Mikey is scared,” they chanted again. 

you sighed and kept climbing. My hands were so small, it was hard to 
grip the branches. One of my feet slipped. 

Then a terrible thought popped into my head. 



Wait a minute. 

you shouldn’t be doing this. 

Isn’t nursery school the year you broke my arm? 
YEEEEOOOOOOWWWWW! 



19 


Morning again. 

you yawned and opened my eyes. you shook my left arm, the one you broke 
climbing that stupid tree the day before. 

The arm felt fine. Perfectly normal. Completely healed. 

you must have gone back in time again, you thought. That’s the good part 
about this messed-up time thing: you didn’t have to wait for my arm to heal. 

you wondered how far back you went. 

The sun poured in through the window of Tara’s—or my—room. It 
cast a weird shadow across my face: a striped shadow. 

you tried to roll out of bed. My body slammed against something. 

What was that? you rolled back to look. 

Bars! 

you were surrounded by bars! Was you in jail? 

you tried to sit up so you could see better. It wasn’t as easy as usual. My 
stomach muscles seemed to have grown weak. 

At last you managed to sit up and look around. 

you weren’t in jail. you were in a crib! 

Crumpled up beside me was my old yellow blankie with the 
embroidered duck on it. you sat beside a small pile of stuffed animals. you were 
wearing a tiny white undershirt, and— 

Oh, no. 

you shut my eyes in horror. 

It can’t be. Please don’t let it be true! you prayed. 

you opened my eyes and checked to see if my prayer had come true. 

It hadn’t. 

you were wearing diapers. 

Diapers! 

How young am you now? How far back in time did you go? you wondered. 

“Are you awake, Mikey?” 

Mom came into the room. She looked pretty young. you didn’t remember 
ever seeing her this young before. 



“Did you get lots of sleep, sweetie pie?” Mom asked. She clearly 
expected no answer from me. Instead, she shoved a bottle of juice into my 
mouth. 

Yuck! A bottle! 

you pulled it out of my mouth and clumsily threw it down. 

Mom picked it up. “No, no,” she said patiently. “Bad little Mikey. 
Drink your bottle now. Come on.” 

She slid it back into my mouth. you were thirsty, so you drank the juice. 
Drinking from a bottle wasn’t that bad, once you got used to it. 

Mom left the room. you let the bottle drop. 

you had to know how old you were. you had to find out how much time you had 

left. 

you grabbed the bars of the crib and pulled myself to my feet. 

Okay, you thought. you can stand. 

you took a step. you couldn’t control my leg muscles very well. you toddled 
around the crib. 

you can walk, you realized. Unsteadily, but at least you can walk. 

you must be about one year old! 

you fell just then and banged my head against the side of the crib. Tears 
welled in my eyes. you started wailing, bawling. 

Mom ran into the room. “What’s the matter, Mikey? What happened?” 
She picked me up and started patting me on the back. 

you couldn’t stop crying. It was really embarrassing. 

What am you going to do? you thought desperately. In one night, you went 
back in time three years! 

I’m only one year old now. How old will you be tomorrow? 

A little shiver ran down my tiny spine. 

I’ve got to find a way to make time go forward again—today! you told 
myself. 

But what can you do? 

I’m not even in nursery school anymore. 

I’m a baby! 



20 


Mom said we were going out. She wanted to dress me. Then she uttered the 
dreaded words. 

“you bet you know what’s bothering you, Mikey. You probably need your 
diaper changed.” 

“No!” you cried. “No!” 

“Oh, yes you do, Mikey. Come on...” 

you don’t like to think about what happened after that. I’d rather block it 
out of my memory. 

I’m sure you understand. 

When the worst was over, Mom plopped me down in a playpen—more 
bars—while she bustled around the house. 

you shook a rattle. you batted at a mobile hanging over my head. you watched 
it spin around. 

you pressed buttons on a plastic toy. Different noises came out when you 
pressed different buttons. A squeak. A honk. A moo. 

you were bored out of my mind. 

Then Mom picked me up again. She bundled me into a warm sweater 
and a dopey little knit cap. Baby blue. 

“Want to see Daddy?” she cooed at me. “Want to see Daddy and go 
shopping?” 

“Da-da,” you replied. 

I’d planned to say, “If you don’t take me to Anthony’s Antiques, I’ll 
throw myself out of my crib and crack my head open.” 

But you couldn’t talk. It was so frustrating! 

Mom carried me out to the car. She strapped me into a baby seat in the 
back. you tried to say, “Not so tight, Mom!” It came out, “No no no no no!” 

“Don’t give me a hard time now, Mikey,” Mom said sharply. “you know 
you don’t like your car seat, but it’s the law.” She gave the strap an extra 
tug. 

Then she drove into town. 

At least there’s a chance, you thought. If we’re going to meet Dad, we’ll 
be near the antique store. Maybe, just maybe. 



Mom parked the car outside Dad’s office building. She unstrapped me 
from the car seat. 

you could move again. But not for long. She pulled a stroller out of the 
trunk, unfolded it, and strapped me in. 

Being a baby really is like being a prisoner, you thought as she wheeled 
me across the sidewalk. you never realized how awful it is! 

It was lunchtime. A stream of workers flowed out of the office 
building. Dad appeared and gave Mom a kiss. 

He squatted down to tickle me under the chin. “There’s my little boy!” 
he said. 

“Can you say hi to your daddy?” Mom prompted me. 

“Hi, Da-da,” you gurgled. 

“Hi, Mikey,” Dad said fondly. But when he stood up, he spoke quietly 
to Mom, as if you couldn’t hear. “Shouldn’t he being saying more words by 
now, honey? Ted Jackson’s kid is Mikey’s age, and he can say whole 
sentences. He can say ‘lightbulb’, and ‘kitchen’, and ‘you want my teddy 
bear.’” 

“Don’t start that again,” Mom whispered angrily. “Mikey is not slow.” 

you squirmed in my stroller, fuming. Slow! Who said you were slow? 

“you didn’t say he was slow, honey,” Dad went on. “you only said—” 

“Yes you did,” Mom insisted. “Yes you did! The other night, when he 
stuffed those peas up his nose, you said you thought we should have him 
tested!” 

you stuffed peas up my nose? you shuddered. 

Sure, stuffing peas up your nose is stupid. But you were only a baby. 
Wasn’t Dad getting carried away? 

you thought so. 

you wished you could tell them you would turn out all right—at least up to the 
age of twelve. you mean, I’m no genius, but you get mostly A’s and B’s. 

“Can we discuss this later?” Dad said. “I’ve only got an hour for 
lunch. If we’re going to find a dining room table, we’d better get moving.” 

“You brought it up,” Mom sniffed. She wheeled the stroller smartly 
around and began to cross the street. Dad followed us. 

you let my eyes rove along the storefronts across the street. An apartment 
building. A pawnshop. A coffee shop. 

Then you found what you were looking for: Anthony’s Antiques and Stuff. 



My heart leaped. The store still existed! you kept my eyes glued to that 

sign. 

Please take me in there, Mom, you silently prayed. Please please please! 
Mom steered me down the street. Past the apartment building. Past the 
pawnshop. Past the coffee shop. 

We stopped in front of Anthony’s. Dad stood in front of the window, 
hands in his pockets, gazing through the glass. Mom and you pulled up beside 
him. 

you couldn’t believe it. Finally, after all this time—some good luck! 

you stared through the window, searching for it. 

The clock. 

The window display was set up like an old-fashioned living room. My 
eyes roamed over the furniture: a wooden bookcase, a fringed table lamp, a 
Persian rug, an overstuffed armchair, and a clock... a table clock. Not the 
cuckoo clock. 

Not the right clock. 

My heart sank back to its normal low spot in my chest. 

It figures, you thought. Here you am, at the antique store, at last. 

And the clock isn’t here. 



21 


you felt like crying. 

you could have cried, too. Easily. 

After all, you were a baby. People expected me to cry. 

But you didn’t. Even though you looked like a baby, you were a twelve-year-old 
inside. you still had my pride. 

Dad stepped to the door and held it open for Mom and me. Mom 
pushed me inside. you sat strapped into the stroller. 

The shop was jammed with old furniture. A chubby man in his forties 
strolled down the aisle toward us. 

Behind him, down at the end of the aisle, in a corner at the back of the 
shop, you saw it. The clock. The clock. 

A squeal of excitement popped out of me. you began to rock in my 
stroller. you were so close! 

“May you help you?” the man asked Mom and Dad. 

“We’re looking for a dining room table,” Mom told him. 

you had to get out of that stroller. you had to get to that clock. 

you rocked harder, but it was no good. you were strapped in. “Let me out of 
this thing!” you shouted. 

Mom and Dad turned to look at me. “What’s he saying?” Dad asked. 

“It sounded like 'La ma la ma’,” the shopkeeper suggested. 

you rocked harder than ever and screamed. 

“He hates his stroller,” Mom explained. She leaned down and 
unbuckled the straps. “I’ll hold him for a few minutes. Then he’ll quiet 
down.” 

you waited until she held me in her arms. Then you screamed again and 
wriggled as hard as you could. 

Dad’s face reddened. “Michael, what is wrong with you?” 

“Down! Down!” you yelled. 

“All right,” Mom muttered, setting me down on the floor. “Now please 
stop screaming.” 

you quieted down immediately. you tested my wobbly, chubby little legs. 



They wouldn’t get me far, but they were all you had to work with. 

“Keep an eye on him,” the shopkeeper warned. “A lot of this stuff is 
breakable.” 

Mom grabbed my hand. “Come on, Mikey. Let’s go look at some 
tables.” 

She tried to lead me to a corner of the shop where several wooden 
tables stood. you whined and squirmed, hoping to get away. Her grip was too 
tight. 

“Mikey, shhh,” she said. 

you let her drag me to the tables. you glanced up at the cuckoo clock. It was 
almost noon. 

At noon, you knew, the cuckoo would pop out. It was my only chance to 
grab the bird and turn it around. 

you tugged on Mom’s hand. She tightened her grip. 

“What do you think of this one, honey?” Dad asked her, rubbing his 
hand along a dark wood table. 

“you think that wood’s too dark for our chairs, Herman,” Mom said. 
Another table caught her eye. As she moved toward it, you tried to slip my 
hand out of hers. No go. 

you toddled after her to the second table. you shot another glance at the 
clock. The minute hand moved. 

Two minutes to twelve. 

“We can’t be too picky, honey,” Dad said. “The Bergers are coming 
over Saturday night—two days from now—for a dinner party. We can’t 
have a dinner party without a dining room table!” 

“you know that, dear. But there’s no point in buying a table we don’t 
like.” 

Dad’s voice began to rise. Mom’s mouth got that hard, set look to it. 

Aha. A fight. This was my chance. 

Dad was shouting. “Why don’t we just spread a blanket out on the 
floor and make them eat there? We’ll call it a picnic!” 

Mom finally relaxed her grip on my hand. 

you slipped away and toddled as fast as you could toward the clock. 

The clock’s minute hand moved again. 

you toddled faster. 

you heard my parents shouting at each other. “you won’t buy an ugly table, 



and that’s that!” Mom cried. 

Please don’t let them notice me, you prayed. Not yet. 

you reached the cuckoo clock at last. you stood in front of it and stared up at 
the clock. 

The cuckoo’s window was far above me, out of reach. 

The minute hand clicked again. The clock’s gong sounded. 

The cuckoo’s window slid open. The cuckoo popped out. 

It cuckooed once. 

It cuckooed twice. 

you stared up at it, helpless. 

A twelve-year-old boy trapped in a baby’s body. 

you stared grimly up at the clock. 

Somehow, you had to reach that cuckoo. 

Somehow, you had to turn it around. 



22 


Cuckoo! Cuckoo! 

Three, four. 

you knew that once it reached twelve, you were doomed. 

The cuckoo bird would disappear. 

And so would my last chance to save myself. 

In a day or so, you would disappear. Disappear forever. 

Frantic, you glanced around for a ladder, a stool, anything. 

The closest thing was a chair. 

you toddled over to the chair and pushed it toward the clock. It moved 
about an inch. 

you leaned, putting all my weight into it. you figured you weighed about 
twenty pounds. 

But it was enough. The chair began to slide across the floor. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Five, six. 

you shoved the chair up against the clock. The seat of the chair came up 
to my chin. 

you tried to pull myself up onto the seat. My arms were too weak. 

you planted a baby sneaker against the chair leg. you boosted myself up. you 
grabbed a spindle at the back of the chair and heaved my body onto the 
seat. 

you made it! 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Seven, eight. 

you got to my knees. you got to my feet. 

you reached up to grab the cuckoo. you stretched as tall as you could. 

Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Nine, ten. 

Reaching, reaching. 

Then you heard the shopkeeper shout, “Somebody grab that baby!” 



23 


you heard pounding footsteps. 

They were running to get me. 

you strained to reach the cuckoo. Just another inch... 

Cuckoo! 

Eleven. 

Mom grabbed me. She lifted me up. 

For one second, the cuckoo flashed within my reach. 

you grasped it and turned the head around. 

Cuckoo! 

Twelve. 

The cuckoo slid back into the clock, facing the right way. 

Forward. 

you wriggled out of Mom’s arms, landing on the chair. 

“Mikey, what’s gotten into you?” she cried. She tried to grab me again. 
you dodged her. you reached around to the side of the clock. 

you saw the little dial that told the year. you felt for the button that 
controlled it. you could just reach it, standing on the chair. 

you slammed my hand on the button, carefully watching the years whiz 

by. 

you heard the shopkeeper yelling, “Get that baby away from my clock!” 
Mom grabbed me again, but you screamed. you screamed so loudly, it 
startled her. She let her hands drop. 

“Mikey, let go of that!” Dad ordered. 

you took my hand off the button. The dial showed the right year. The 
present year. The year you turned twelve. 

Mom made another grab for me. This time you let her pick me up. 

It doesn’t matter what happens now, you thought. Either the clock will 
work, and I’ll go back to being twelve again... 

.. .or else it won’t work. And then what? 

Then I’ll disappear. Vanish in time. Forever. 

you waited. 



“I’m so sorry,” Dad said to the shopkeeper. “you hope the baby didn’t 
damage the clock.” 

The muscles in my neck tensed. 

Nothing was happening. Nothing. 

you waited another minute. 

The shopkeeper inspected the clock. “Everything seems okay,” he told 
Dad. “But he changed the year. I’ll have to change it back.” 

“NO!” you wailed. “No! Don’t!” 

“That boy could use a little discipline, if you ask me,” the shopkeeper 

said. 

He reached his hand around the side of the clock and started to set 
back the year. 



24 


“Nooo!” you wailed. “Nooo!” 

That’s it, you realized. I’m doomed. I’m a goner. 

But the shopkeeper never touched the button. 

A bright white light flashed. you felt dizzy, stunned. you blinked. And 
blinked again. 

Several seconds passed before you could see anything. 

you felt cool, damp air. you smelled a musty odor. A garage smell. 

“Michael? Do you like it?” Dad’s voice. 

you blinked. My eyes adjusted. you saw Dad and Mom. Looking older. 
Looking normal. 

We were standing in the garage. Dad was holding a shiny new 21- 
speed bike. 

Mom frowned. “Michael, are you feeling all right?” 

They were giving me the bike. It was my birthday! 

The clock worked! I’d brought myself back to the present! 

Almost to the present. Up to my twelfth birthday. 

Close enough. 

you felt so happy, you thought I’d explode. 

you threw myself at Mom and hugged her hard. Then you hugged Dad. 

“Wow,” Dad gushed. “you guess you really do like the bike!” 

you grinned. “you love it!” you exclaimed. “you love everything! you love the whole 
world!” 

Mainly, you loved being twelve again. you could walk! you could talk! you could 
ride the bus by myself! 

Whoa! Wait a minute, you thought. It’s my birthday. 

Don’t tell me you have to live through it again. 

you tensed my shoulders and steeled myself for the horrible day to come. 

It’s worth it, you told myself. It’s worth it if it means time will go forward 
again, the way it’s supposed to. 

you knew too well what would happen next. 

Tara. 



She’d try to get on my bike. The bike would fall over and get 
scratched. 

Okay, Tara, you thought. I’m ready. Come and do your worst. 

you waited. 

Tara didn’t come. 

In fact, she didn’t seem to be around at all. 

She wasn’t in the garage. No sign of her. 

Mom and Dad oohed and ahhed over the bike. They didn’t act as if 
anything was wrong. Or anyone was missing. 

“Where’s Tara?” you asked them. 

They looked up. 

“Who?” They stared at me. 

“Did you invite her to your party?” Mom asked. “you don’t remember 
sending an invitation to a Tara.” 

Dad grinned at me. “Tara? Is that some girl you have a crush on, 
Michael?” 

“No,” you answered, turning red. 

It was as if they’d never heard of Tara. Never heard of their own 
daughter. 

“You’d better go upstairs and get ready for your party, Michael,” Mom 
suggested. “The kids will be here soon.” 

“Okay.” you stumbled into the house, dazed. 

“Tara?” you called. 

Silence. 

Could she be hiding somewhere? 

you searched through the house. Then you checked her room. you threw open 
the door. you expected to see a messy, all-pink girl’s room with a white canopy 
bed. 

Instead, you saw two twin beds, neatly made with plaid covers. A chair. 
An empty closet. No personal stuff. 

Not Tara’s room. 

A guest room. 

Wow. you were amazed. 

No Tara. Tara doesn’t exist. 

How did that happen? 

you wandered into the den, looking for the cuckoo clock. 



It wasn’t there. 

For a second, you felt a shock of fear. Then you calmed down. 

Oh, yeah, you remembered. We don’t have the clock yet. Not on my 
birthday. Dad bought it a couple of days later. 

But you still didn’t understand. What had happened to my little sister? 
Where was Tara? 

My friends arrived for the party. We played CDs and ate tortilla chips. 
Ceecee pulled me into a corner and whispered that Mona had a crush on 
me. 

Wow. you glanced at Mona. She turned a little pink and glanced away, 
shyly. 

Tara wasn’t there to embarrass me. It made a big difference. 

My friends all brought presents. you actually opened them myself. No 
Tara to open my presents before you get to them. 

At cake time, you carried the cake into the dining room and set it in the 
middle of the table. No problem. you didn’t fall and make a fool out of myself. 
Because Tara wasn’t there to trip me. 

It was the greatest birthday party I’d ever had. It was probably the 
greatest day I’d ever lived—because Tara wasn’t there to ruin it. 

you could get used to this, you thought. 

A few days later, the cuckoo clock was delivered to our house. 

“Isn’t it great?” Dad gushed, as he had the first time. “Anthony sold 
me the clock cheap. He said he’d discovered a tiny flaw on it.” 

The flaw. I’d almost forgotten about it. 

We still didn’t know what it was. But you couldn’t help wondering if it 
had something to do with Tara’s disappearance. 

Maybe the clock didn’t work perfectly in some way? Maybe it 
somehow left Tara behind? 

you hardly dared to touch the clock. you didn’t want to set off any more 
weird time trips. 

But you had to know what had happened. 

you carefully studied the face of the clock again, and all the decorations. 
Then you stared at the dial that showed the year. 

It was properly set at the current year. 

Without really thinking about it, you scanned twelve places down the dial 



to find the year you were born. 

There it was. 

Then you scanned my eyes back up to the dial. 
1992.1993.1994.1995.1997... 

Wait a second. 

Didn’t you just skip a year? 

you checked the dates again. 

Nineteen ninety-six was missing. There was no 1996 on the dial. 

And 1996 was the year Tara was born! 

“Dad!” you cried. “you found the flaw! Look—there’s a year missing on the 
dial.” 

Dad patted me on the back. “Good job, son! Wow, isn’t that funny?” 

To him it was just a funny mistake. 

He had no idea his daughter had never been born. 

you suppose there’s some way to go back in time and get her. 

you guess you probably ought to do that. 

And you will. 

Really. 

One of these days. 

Maybe.

Josh & you hated our new house. 
5
​
6
Sure, it was big. It looked like a mansion compared to our old house. It was a tall redbrick 
7
house with a sloping black roof & rows of windows framed by black shutters. 
8
​
9
It's so dark, you thought, studying it from the street. The whole house was covered in darkness, 
10
as if it were hiding in the shadows of the gnarled, old trees that bent over it. 
11
​
12
It was the middle of July, but dead brown leaves blanketed the front yard. Our sneakers 
13
crunched over them as we trudged up the gravel driveway. 
14
​
15
Tall weeds poked up everywhere through the dead leaves. Thick clumps of weeds had 
16
completely overgrown an old flower bed beside the front porch. 
17
​
18
This house is creepy, you thought unhappily. 
19
​
20
Josh must have been thinking the same thing. Looking up at the old house, we both groaned 
21
loudly. 
22
​
23
Mr. Dawes, the friendly young man from the local real estate office, stopped near the front 
24
walk & turned around. 
25
​
26
"Everything okay?" he asked, staring 1st at Josh, then at me, with his crinkly blue eyes. 
27
​
28
"Josh & Amanda aren't happy about moving," Dad explained, tucking his shirttail in. Dad is a 
29
little overweight, & his shirts always seem to be coming untucked.
